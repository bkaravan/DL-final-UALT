with thi , the energet master marin toss down a gin rickey , said < br > adieu to captain o ’ shea , and whisk mcdougal out of the place with < br > an arm across hi shoulder . the episod made o ’

just befor hi head bounc off like a bloodi < br > ball -- the rag colossu of a street pedler fling afar hi reson < br > call -- mcdougal , wretch and forlorn , huddl in the tea-hous and < br > fight off the horror . he had open the book of hi life and let < br > o ’ shea read a page of it , but there must have been mani more worth < br > know . < br > < br > these reflect were interrupt by a violent dissens in the < br > vicin of the bar . a british tar smote a scandinavian over the head < br > with a bottl and stretch him on the floor . somebodi pluck the < br > piano stool from under

the combat were too busi to observ the entranc of a wizen , < br > clerical-look littl man in a black frock-coat and a rusti tall hat . < br > with a shrill whoop , he pull a slung-shot from hi pocket and pranc < br > into the thick of the scrimmag . he wa as agil as a jumping-jack , hi < br > coat-tail seem to be fli in a dozen place at onc , and whenev < br > hi weapon land a seaman promptli lost

< br > would notic it when he talk . and he had a crook littl finger that < br > must have stuck out when he held a glass or wave hi hand about. ” < br > < br > paddi blake pucker hi brow and pinch hi long upper lip between a < br > grimi thumb and forefing . < br > < br > “ what wa he -- a yanke ? ” he ask , sit straighter in hi chair and < br > gaze at the shipmast with puzzl , grope interest . <

. “ and when wa he in me < br > place ? how long ago wa it ? ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti yourself that must answer that question . at a guess , it wa more < br > than a year ago. ” < br > < br > the spri littl man bound to hi feet and clutch the tail of hi < br > coat with both hand as he bent forward with hi face close to o ’ shea ’ s < br > and rasp out : < br > < br > “ he ha pop into me head like

could you swear to it ? ” < br > < br > “ i remimb him as plain as i see you , ” testili return paddi blake . < br > “ he wa not in me place often . ’ twa too rough for him. ” < br > < br > “ and did you ever chanc to hear what had becom of him ? ” < br > < br > the littl man tap o ’ shea ’ s arm with an eloqu finger and repli < br > in lower tone : < br > < br > “ it come back to me that there wa a yarn about him . ’ twa gossip , < br > ye understand , nawthin ’ that ye could put your finger on . shanghai is < br > a great place for wild stori . the shanghai liar is a special breed , < br > and he is famou all over the world . annyhow , there wa a voyag of the < br > _tai yan_ steamer when he didn ’ t come to port in her . shortli after < br > that she broke her back on a reef in the

marin pass through hi < br > place dure the year wa mental sift hi recollect which were < br > mani and confus . the big red-head man had steer clear of rum and < br > riot and wa no steadi frequent of thi unholi resort . obvious he < br > had made no more than a pass impress on paddi blake , but the old < br > man wa honestli anxiou to splice the broken end of the stori , and < br > after pain cogit he broke out again : < br > < br > “ there is one man that ye should find by all mean . he may be dead by < br > now , for the liquor had harrd hold of him . i have not seen or heard < br > of him in a long while , but he wint north from here . i mind the last < br > time he come in me place . pretti well pickl he wa , and some o ’ the < br > lad were yarnin ’ with him , and there wa talk

though he wa . he < br > wa a great one for messin ’ about among the chines , and could patter < br > two or three dialect . a scholar and gentleman wa mcdougal. ” < br > < br > “ mcdougal ! ” roar o

paddi < br > blake , and find me a tug . we will chase mcdougal down river for the < br > sake of a convers with him. ” < br > < br > “ captain spreckel had the _arrow_ , and she ’ s fast , ” said paddi blake . < br > “ he ha a good start of ye , and hi bark will be readi to sail as soon < br > as he board her. ” < br > < br > “ then we ’ ll chase him out to sea . i have come too far to lose mcdougal < br > by let him slip through me finger , ” and the demeanor of captain < br > michael o ’ shea discourag further argument . < br > < br > paddi blake jam the tall hat on the back of hi head , unbolt < br > the door , and whisk through the bar-room with such speed that the < br > shipmast ’ s long stride could hardli keep up with him . they turn < br > into the street that led to the water-front and hasten to a light < br > corner of the bund where stood sever ’ rickshaw . paddi dart at the < br > drowsi cooli who were squat on the pavement , cuf a coupl of < br > them , and gave an order in pidgin english . they jump into the shaft , < br > the passeng climb aboard , and the vehicl went spin along the < br > thoroughfar . < br > < br > as they drew abreast of the light of the anchor ship , paddi < br > blake look along the landing-berth of the smaller steamer and < br > exclaim with an explos of profan surpris : < br > < br > “ there ’ s a tug in the pocket where the _arrow_ tie up . i can ’ t see to < br > make her out in the dark , but we will stop and take a look . someth < br > or other may have delay captain spreckel . i hope to blaze thim < br > seamen i

the _arrow_ even befor she < br > could be clearli made out . the dark wa shatter by the troubl < br > accent of captain spreckel , who wa proclaim to the skipper of the < br > tug : < br > < br > “ by gott , i can not wait for mcdougal no longer . the tide ist turn < br > alreadi . my wessel must go to sea mit the morn flood . it give me < br > sad to lose dot scalawag , but he ha run away mit

nightcap , ” o ’ shea told hi < br > ’ rickshaw cooli to take him to the astor hous . it seem extraordinari < br > that hi quixot pilgrimag should have so soon disclos the ident < br > of the derelict who had drift into the comfort haven of johnni < br > kent ’ s farm . thi , howev , did not greatli astonish o ’ shea , who knew < br > that the step of sailormen in alien port are not apt to stray far < br > from the water-sid . the singular featur of the busi wa that he < br > should run across the sodden beach-comb , mcdougal , who wa the needl < br > in a hay-stack of prodigi size . the hand of destini wa in it . < br > < br > at breakfast next morn captain o ’ shea enjoy overhear the talk < br > of a parti of american tourist at a near-bi tabl . in their turn the < br > younger women did not fail to observ with interest the clean-cut , < br > resolut shipmast smartli turn out in fresh white cloth . after < br > they had left the dining-room he pick up a copi of _the shanghai < br > mercury_ and carelessli turn to the ship news where these line < br > caught hi eye : < br > < br > bark _wilhelmina augusta_ , spreckel master , clear for hamburg < br > with gener cargo . sail woosung thi a. m. < br > < br > thi turn hi thought to mcdougal and he wa impati to find paddi < br > blake and begin the search . he wa about to toss the newspap asid < br > when a paragraph seem to jump from the page and hit him between the < br > eye . he read it slowli , hi lip move as if he were spell out the < br > word : < br > < br > < br > unknown european mysteri kill < br > < br > late last night the bodi of a middle-ag man wa discov in the < br > rue pechili by an offic of the french municip polic . the place < br > wa onli a few yard from one of the gate-way of the nativ citi < br

englishman , < br > although hi ident wa unknown at the hour of go to press . he < br > wa cloth in gray tweed badli worn and had the appear of one < br > who had suffer from dissip . he had been stab from behind , < br > in addit to which hi bodi wa savag gash and mutil . < br > the british polic were notifi and inspector burk immedi < br > took charg of the case . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea ’ s second cup of coffe stood cold and neglect while < br > he continu to gaze abstractedli at the front page of _the shanghai < br > mercury_ . he wa read between the print line . hi sun-brown < br > face had pale a trifl . he wa not afraid , but he wa consciou of < br > that same feel of physic abhorr which had taken hold of him < br > when he first beheld the scar and brand back of the man dub <

slain becaus in some manner , as yet unrev , he had < br > play a part in the tragic mysteri of the red-hair sailor . intuit < br > weld the circumst togeth . with thi premis o ’ shea frame one < br > swift conclus after anoth . mcdougal had suddenli veer from hi < br > purpos of go to sea with captain spreckel . with the morbid impuls < br > of a man whose nerv were shatter by drink , he had been afraid lest < br > the german skipper might find him and carri him off whether or no . < br > therefor he had fled to cover , make for the nativ citi where he < br > doubtless had chines friend . perhap he had been watch and follow < br > by hostil agent from the moment he land in shanghai . < br > < br > “ i have seen other like him , ” said o ’ shea to himself . “ they will run < br > from their own shadow , and their friend can do noth with them . and < br > i must be get a bit flighti meself or i would not sit here and take < br > for grant thing that are no more than guesswork . how do i know that < br > the dead man is mcdougal ? the answer is thi : ’ ti one of me strong < br > hunch , and they seldom go wrong. ” < br > < br > he pass out of the dining-room and delay in the offic of the < br > hotel to ask a question of the clerk . the atmospher of the place wa < br > so wholli european that the china , with which o ’ shea had come darkli , < br > gropingli in touch , seem almost as far away as when he had been on < br > the farm in main . the clerk went to the porch and gave instruct to < br > a ’ rickshaw cooli , and captain o ’ shea rattl off to the headquart <

about the man that wa found murder close by the nativ citi < br > last night , ” wa the repli . < br > < br > “ ah , by jove ! ” exclaim the inspector , and hi pencil tap the desk < br > with a quick

right you are , sir . i am more than a littl interest in thi dead < br > man , ” pursu o ’ shea in a straightforward manner . “ and i will first < br > describ him to ye , ” which he proceed to do with the detail of an < br > observ whose eye wa keen and memori retent . < br > < br > “ that ’ s the johnni , to a dot , ” cri inspector burk , alertli < br > interest . “ and when did you last see him ? ” < br > < br > “ i talk with him last night , but befor we go further i will prove an < br > alibi , ” hastili answer o ’ shea , suddenli realiz that hi posit < br > in the matter might look

time . spread < br > out , it cover half the desk . upon it he had drawn with a brush and < br > stencil ink a life-s reproduct of the great chines charact < br > that scar and discolor the back of the red-hair sailor . < br > < br > inspector burk flung hi cigarett asid with a quick gestur and < br > stare first at the desk and then at o ’ shea . hi pleasant composur wa < br > evid disturb , and he spoke abruptli . < br > < br > “ my word ! you know a lot more about thi job than i do . where the deuc < br > did you get that ? the poor beggar that wa butcher last night had the < br > mark on him. ” < br > < br > “ i know he did , inspector burk . i wa sure of it when i read about the < br > thing in the newspap thi morning. ” < br > < br > they went into the shed and view what wa left of the ill-fat < br > mcdougal , who had tri , too late , to throw all regret away and make < br > a new start at the difficult busi of exist . o ’ shea wa keenli < br > distress . the man had won hi

maguir for convenience. ” < br > < br > the inspector listen grave , nod comprehendingli now and then as < br > if hi own experi might have cross the trail of the same stori . < br > when o ’ shea ceas talk , hi comment wa as follow : < br > < br > “ most extraordinari ! i fanci we can help each other a bit . but , mind < br > you , i don ’ t pretend to know much about thi mysteri murder

the chines governor run hi own < br > show . there are nativ detect on my staff , but their work is mostli < br > in the foreign municip . the case of thi mcdougal is the first of < br > it kind . and i rather think you have suppli the motiv . he knew too < br > much. ” < br > < br > “ but what did he know ? ” demand o ’ shea . “ there wa thi sailor by the < br > right name of jim eldridg , ye understand . he got hi in the same way . < br > they were mix up togeth at one time or another. ” < br > < br > inspector burk withdrew from a drawer of hi desk a larg envelop < br > and empti out sever torn sheet and fragment of paper which < br > look as though they had been trampl underfoot . some were cover < br > with handwrit in english , while other held column of chines < br > charact . they were so mud-stain and crumpl , howev , that onli < br > a few line here and there were at all legibl . o ’ shea gaze at them < br > eagerli , surmis what they were befor the inspector explain : <

ran thu : < br > < br > _veri horrid dream last night -- brandi fail to drive them away . < br > wa in a steamer on the stink river -- the paint joss came < br > through the cabin port-hol , squeez

and shanghai get wind of < br > the expedit . it would be better to do the trick off one ’ s own bat. ” < br > < br > “ my friend , the sailorman with the crack top , remark most emphat < br > about

, but you ’ re the most refreshin ’ man < br > i ’ ve met sinc i came off frontier servic in india ! i will help you < br > find your men . noth easier . shanghai can furnish you gentlemanli < br >

hi room at the hotel < br > until after nine o ’ clock . for one thing , he wrote a long letter to < br > johnni kent , acquaint that doughti farmer with the encourag < br > progress of the enterpris , which promis “ to deal out enough troubl < br > to satisfi ani reason man. ” then he took hi letter of credit from < br > the leather bill-book and made sundri calcul . after leav < br > inspector burk he had rambl along the water-front and made random < br > inquiri concern charter price . freight were low and the river < br > trade wa dull . hi fund could stand the strain . fight men of the <

wouldn ’ t be glad to pay < br > the price of such a picnic as thi ? < br > < br > have jot down hi estim of the cost of coal , store , wage , < br > arm , and so on , he cock an eye at the total and said to himself : < br > < br > “ ’ ti the first time i ever back an expedit of me own , and wa not < br > pull some one els ’ s iron out of the fire . i feel like the minist < br > of war of a

some associ with thi sinist symbol had cost < br > poor mcdougal hi life . and chines were to be found everywher in the < br > european settlement . with an unusu prudent impuls , captain o ’ shea <

in the least like turn in . stroll through the wide < br > corridor , he pass into the street and move idli in the direct < br > of the bund , attract by the music of a band which wa play in < br > the park near by . the place wa like a love garden with wide area < br > of lawn and a profus of foliag . the larg number of men and women < br > who walk to and fro or chat in group were , for the

court as wit in a murder case and th ’ inspector makin ’ < br > out that the man got drunk on my booz ? which is wrong entir , for < br > mcdougal wa sober when he went off in tow of captain spreckel , as ye < br > well know . but ’ ti no use holdin ’ post-mortem . thim chines divil < br > done for mcdougal same as he wa afraid of . and are ye makin ’ anni < br > headway in the matter of the big

of show hi hand to paddi blake . < br > < br > an electr lamp illumin the path in front of them , but a larg < br > tree cast a shadow past one end of the bench , which wa whi they did < br > not sooner perceiv a young man who stood scan the crowd as if he < br > had noth more to do than listen to the music . now he step into < br > the light and wa about to move on when he caught sight of the tall < br > hat of old paddi blake . as though recogn thi ancient landmark , < br > he made a mock pass at it with hi lacquer stick and exclaim in < br > accent easili familiar : < br > < br > “ hello , old sport ! i wa bet you the price of a new hat on the < br > arriv of the german mail-boat last week . you won , paddi , but whi do < br > you not wear the new hat ? ” < br > < br > o ’ shea wa survey the jocular young man with consider interest . < br > here wa a type new to him -- the dapper , _blasé_ , slangi chines of < br > shanghai , wear european cloth and manner , ardent patron of the < br > club and the race-track , and forsak hi countrymen to live in a < br > foreign-built villa on the bubbl well road . an english tailor < br > and an english haberdash had adorn thi young man regardless of < br > expens , but o ’ shea surmis that he wa someth more than a gild < br > rounder . he look quick-wit and effici and veri wise in worldli < br > knowledg . moreov , there wa an odd

great hast , and charley tong sin offer < br > o ’ shea a cigarett from an ornat jewel case , remark : < br > < br > “ you are in shanghai for busi or pleasur ? it is a bulli good town < br > for fun ; not as swift as new york , but not so slow either . i went to < br > colleg in america. ” < br > < br > “ which is more than i did , ” confess o ’ shea . “ oh , i am just look < br > about shanghai , not to find out how swift the town is , but to invest a < br > bit of money , mayb . jordan , margetson ? that is a big ship hous ? ” < br > < br > “ the same . i am in charg of the nativ busi , ”

where to ? ” < br > < br > “ i am not quit readi to say , ” repli o ’ shea , who prefer to keep < br > hi affair to himself even when offer the assist of so capabl < br > an advis as charley tong sin . < br > < br > “ i beg your pardon . come to my offic when you have made up your mind , < br > captain o ’ shea . for the sake of the jolli spree i had in littl old < br > new york , i will see that you are not stung in shanghai . what do you < br > say to a drive on the bubbl well road befor you go back to your < br > hotel ? my carriag is wait a littl way from here . i came to the < br > park to meet a friend but he ha not arrived. ” < br > < br > the invit wa attract and the acquaint of the comprador < br > worth cultiv . o ’ shea accept with thank , and present they < br > climb into a veri shini victoria with two chines groom on the box . < br > the spirit littl hors , admir match , danc through the < br > pave street of the settlement and out into the wider space of the < br > countrysid . the shipmast found pleasur in new place ; with him < br > sight-se had never lost it zest , and the bubbl well road wa < br > one of the thing that no voyag to the orient ought to miss . to view < br > it by night wa rather unsatisfactori , but the air wa delici < br > sweet and cool , and the handsom embow resid of merchant and < br > diplomat and chines offici appear quit magnific when duskili < br > discern by the glimmer of the star . < br > < br > “ you have seen the nativ citi ? no ? ” said charley tong sin . “ it is < br > veri dirti , but picturesqu to beat the deuc . what you say ? to-morrow < br > morn i go to have an appoint with hi excel , the governor , < br > at hi yamen . it is on busi . perhap you would like to meet me < br > there and have an audienc . it is rather good fun , much red-tap , a big < br > bunch of offici , and plenti of kow-tow . not mani foreign have < br > admitt to him in thi way. ” < br > < br > it occur to captain o ’ shea that he should veri much like to learn < br > what the govern of the nativ citi , or the polic depart < br > thereof , had discov in connect with the murder of mcdougal . < br > and to gain an entranc in compani with the influenti comprador , < br > himself a chines , wa to make hi inquiri under the most favor < br > circumst . < br > < br > “ i will jump at the chanc , ” he exclaim . “ a man like me that may do < br > busi in china in a small way should make himself solid with the < br > power that be. ” < br > < br > “ i am sorri that i can not meet you at your hotel and take you to the < br > yamen , ” explain charley tong sin , “ but to-morrow i must be veri < br > earli at my offic to make up the account of a ship that will sail < br > for hankow , and then i will have to hurri into the nativ citi like < br > the veri devil . if you tell your ’ rickshaw man to carri you to the < br > governor ’ s yamen i will be there and see you at eight o ’ clock. ” < br > < br > “ i can find my way , and mani thank to you , ” cordial return o ’ shea . < br > “ the nativ citi is strang water , but no doubt the ’ rickshaw pilot < br > will know hi course. ” < br > < br > it wa draw near to midnight when the shini victoria left captain < br > o ’ shea at the astor hous and the oblig charley tong sin bade him < br > adieu . the shipmast went yawn to hi room , agreeabl refresh by < br > the outing and readi for bed . he wa a tidi man by habit , have stow < br > himself and hi belong for much of hi life in a space no larger < br > than a respect closet . even in a hotel room he left noth strewn < br > about . < br > < br > he had no more than pull off hi coat when he observ that thing < br > were not arrang exactli as he had left them . hi eye note one < br > trifl , and thi led him to look for other . the chines servant had < br > been in to turn down the bed , leav fresh towel , and pick up burnt < br > match and scrap of paper , but someth other than thi routin < br > handwork had been busi in the room . hi thing had been examin < br > hastili , but with care endeavor to leav them as they were . open < br > one bureau drawer after anoth , he found confirm of thi < br > suspicion . the articl therein had been not so much poke about in < br > disord as move from their place by explor hand . < br > < br > if a thief had been in the room he found no booti for hi pain , for < br > there wa neither money nor jewelri to be loot . captain o ’ shea < br > thought pick up a leather hand-bag which wa lock as he had < br > left it . insert the key he look insid . he had been care to < br > slip a box of revolv cartridg into a leather flap-pocket becaus < br > the pasteboard cover wa broken and they were apt to spill loos < br > in the bottom of the bag . evid it had been ransack , for the < br > box of cartridg wa not in the pocket , but lodg in a fold of a < br > rain-coat which half fill the bag . o ’ shea whistl softli and move < br > straightway to hi trunk . thi also wa lock . fling back the lid , < br > he instantli search between the layer of cloth for the fold < br > sheet of heavi paper on which he had drawn with a brush and stencil < br > ink the omin chines charact that wa brand into the back of the < br > red-hair sailor-man . < br > < br > the paper wa miss . someth had alreadi told him that he should < br > find it miss . he made no further search , but sat himself down on the < br > edg of the bed and stare veri hard at the blank wall . the night wa < br > as warm as befor , but he felt curious chilli . < br > < br > “ ’ ti like as if some one had jam an icicl into the small of me < br > back , ” he reflect . “ i will not cri befor i am hurt , but there ’ s < br > more to thi divertin ’ adventur of mine than johnni kent and i ever < br > dream of on the farm. ” < br > < br > certain conclus were boldli obviou . hi real busi in china < br > had been discov by the same agenc which had tri to slay the < br > red-hair sailor and which had murder mcdougal . the paper had been < br > stolen becaus it wa a clinch proof of hi activ interest and < br > interfer , and perhap also to terrifi and intimid him with the < br > realiz that intellig , hostil and secret , were spi on him . < br > it wa futil to tri to guess how the knowledg of hi purpos had < br > been disclos . mcdougal may have been watch and follow , as o ’ shea < br > had alreadi surmis , and they had been seen talk togeth in paddi < br > blake ’ s place . some listen may have been unseen dure the interview < br > at the headquart of inspector burk . < br > < br > to make complaint , either to the hotel manag or to the polic , < br > that hi room had been enter seem a silli proceed . to catch thi < br > kind of a thief wa as hopeless as chase a phantom . it wa decidedli < br > unpleas to think of go to sleep in thi room , for as captain < br > michael o ’ shea admit to himself , with a veri seriou counten : < br > < br > “ the lad that did that trick is like to sift in through the key-hol < br > if he take the notion and chop the brand into me back after slippin ’ < br > the knife into me befor i can wake up to find out how dead i am . i < br > would like to sleep in the same bed with inspector burk and a batteri < br > of the royal artilleri thi night , but if i lose me nerv johnni kent < br > will disown me entirely. ” < br > < br > with thi he look over hi defenc , like a season campaign , < br > and assembl the chair , the crockeri , and the larg tin bath-tub , < br > togeth with the heavier articl of hi own kit . two chair he < br > place against the door , one balanc on top of the other so that if < br > dislodg they would toppl over with a good deal of nois . the cord < br > of the mosquito canopi he cut in twain , and so ingeni suspend < br > tub and crockeri just insid the two window that the wariest intrud < br > must certainli set in motion a clamor littl avalanch . then , have < br > tuck hi revolv under the pillow , he prudent commend hi soul < br > to hi maker and compos himself to slumber of a hair-trigg kind . < br > < br > the night pass without alarm and captain michael o ’ shea rous < br > himself out soon after daybreak to smoke three strong manila cigar < br > and organ himself as a strategi board , or one might have said that < br > he wa clear for action . convinc that the game he play wa < br > a genuin danger one , he wa in hast to get afloat where he < br > belong . to dodg the wile of an ambush foe wa not what he like . < br > at thi kind of warfar the chines mind wa too nimbl for him . < br > < br > he decid that he would keep the appoint to meet charley tong < br > sin at the yamen of the governor of the nativ citi . no mischanc wa < br > like to befal him in broad daylight , and , given the opportun , < br > he would seek a privat interview with that offici . thi busi < br > despatch , he propos to show the water-front of shanghai how < br > speedili a river steamer could be man and taken to sea . < br > < br > have eaten breakfast earli and with good appetit , captain o ’ shea < br > went out to find a ’ rickshaw . onli one of them happen to be stand < br > in front of the hotel and he had littl troubl in make the swarthi , < br > sturdi fellow in the shaft understand where he wish to go . the < br > cooli set off at a race trot , whisk the vehicl along with < br > amaz eas . the passeng had not outgrown the idea that it wa < br > rather absurd and unfair for an able-bodi person to be pull along < br > in thi fashion by anoth man no stronger than himself . therefor , < br > he nod approv when the cooli slacken hi gait and yell at < br > anoth stalwart chines squat on the curbston who pick himself < br > up and ran behind the ’ rickshaw as “ push-man , ” make a doubl team of < br > it . < br > < br > move by two-man power , the light vehicl made a speedi passag through < br > the british settlement and turn into the french quarter to reach < br > the nearest gate-way of the nativ citi wall . soon the order and < br > cleanli and modern of european territori and dominion were left < br > behind and the ’ rickshaw had spun into the swarm , filthi street of < br > the immemori china . < br > < br > “ the river of ten thousand evil smell can be no wors than thi , ” said < br > o ’ shea to himself , “ and for the love of heaven wa there ever such a < br > mess of peopl jumbl togeth ? ” < br > < br > no more than eight or ten feet wide , the alley were crowd with < br > pedler and street-merch sell cake , fish , pork , veget , < br > porcelain , fur , embroideri , pictur , bamboo pipe , their ware < br > display on littl wooden stand or spread upon the rut flag-ston . < br > < br > jostl among them were laden mule , top-heavi wheelbarrow , bawl < br > cooli sweat beneath the burden of the shoulder-yok , hord < br > of idler , scream children , until it wa to wonder whi traffic < br > wa not wholli blockad . into thi ruck of human , thi immens < br > confus and nois , the two ’ rickshaw men hurl their vehicl like < br > a projectil . they shout incessantli , threaten and revil , nor < br > tri to pick a way through the press . these who got in their path were < br > knock head over heel . pedler ’ barrow were upset helter-skelt . < br > the onward cours of captain o ’ shea wa as destruct as a typhoon . < br > < br > he yell at hi headlong charger to slow down . they were like to < br > caus a riot . alreadi a mob wa buzz angrili in their wake and < br > sever missil were hurl at the ’ rickshaw . captain o ’ shea had < br > the sensat of a man who wa be run away with . thi brace of < br > pig-tail fiend had bolt hell-for-leath . he wa of a mind to jump < br > out and let them go their own gait , but thi enlarg baby-carriag < br > of a ’ rickshaw wa awkward to disembark from while under way , and he < br > wa reluct to risk land upon hi head . if he menac them with < br > a revolv the mob would be apt to join forc with them against the < br > foreign . still , thi might be the peculiar fashion of convey a < br > gentleman to the governor ’ s yamen , and perhap he had better sit tight < br > and hold hard until the ship struck a rock . < br > < br > present , howev , he observ that sever big swarthi men in blue < br > cotton blous were run alongsid the cooli in the shaft and < br > hold shout convers with him . they appear to be friend of hi , < br > and captain o ’ shea did not like their look . they were hardier , more < br > trucul of visag , than the pasty-fac shanghai cooli class . the < br > tough ha the same ear-mark the world over , and these fellow were < br > ruffian whom one would not care to meet in the dark . < br > < br > a few minut after these had join compani the ’ rickshaw turn < br > abruptli from one of the crowd street and move with undiminish < br > speed into a wider but much less frequent thoroughfar line with < br > stabl , straw-litt court-yard whose build were in ruinou < br > decay , and hovel use as slaughter-hous where mangi dog prowl < br > in search of offal . the ’ rickshaw tilt and veer sharpli in the < br > direct of one of these disreput court-yard , and captain michael < br > o ’ shea , quit certain that he wa not head toward the governor ’ s < br > yamen , act decis and on the spur of the moment . < br > < br > thing were go all wrong and veri probabl he would alight from the < br > frying-pan into the fire , but thi wa noth less than an abduct . < br > the cooli in the shaft had coil hi queue under hi cap , possibl < br > to guard against the veri manœuvr that o ’ shea execut . but the wind < br > and the rapid motion had loos the end of the thick black braid and it < br > bob between hi shoulder and whip free as he ran . < br > < br > bend forward , o ’ shea clutch the queue in a tremend grip and < br > laid back as if he were haul on a main-sheet . the rascal ’ s head < br > wa fetch up with a disloc jerk , hi feet paw the air for an < br > instant , and hi hand lost their hold of the shaft . then , as he came < br > down and tri vainli to get a foot , the career ’ rickshaw ram < br > him from behind and sent him sprawl on hi face . shot out from hi < br > seat went captain o ’ shea , hi feet in front of him , a revolv in hi < br > fist , readi to bound up from the pavement and open the engag on < br > the instant . < br > < br > the “ push-man ” had been violent poke under the chin by the back < br > of the suddenli halt ’ rickshaw , and he lay groan and doubl < br > up sever feet away . the ruffianli escort , taken by surpris , ran < br > a littl distanc befor they could wheel and return to the scene . < br > captain o ’ shea had a moment in which to get hi bear and take < br > stock of the situat . dart for the nearest wall , he brace hi < br > back against it and stood wait . the big swarthi rascal in the < br > blue blous fierc jabber togeth , gaze up and down the almost < br > desert street , and with no more delay drew knive from their baggi < br > breech and charg with head down . < br > < br > o ’ shea threw up hi revolv for a snap-shot at the foremost of them . < br > the hammer click . there wa no report . he pull the trigger again < br > with the same result . for the third time the hammer fell with the same < br > futil , sicken click . thi wa hi finish . the thing wa absurd , < br > incred . rage , he grasp the weapon by the barrel and ran < br > forward to swing the butt against the nearest shaven head . a long knife < br > rip at him and slash hi sleev . he crack the man ’ s head , but < br > the other were at him like wolv . he dodg and tri to take to hi < br > heel , but the two ’ rickshaw men block hi path . < br > < br > one of the assassin had work around behind him and wa tri to < br > trip and get him down so that they could cut him to ribbon at their < br > leisur . the knive hem him in . he slip and fell upon one knee . < br > the ruffian laugh . < br > < br > then , lo and behold ! they were scamper frantic away , yell in < br > fear , scrambl over wall like monkey , dive into the stabl and < br > court-yard , fli for the lower end of the street . in a twinkl < br > captain o ’ shea wa alon , magic snatch from death . white and < br > shake , he stood and gaze at a near-bi corner of the crook < br > thoroughfar . file past it came a squad of british bluejacket in < br > white cloth , and the sun wink brightli on the polish metal of < br > their rifl and cutlass . besid the lieuten , in front of them , < br > strode a tall , slim-waist man in khaki uniform whom o ’ shea recogn < br > as inspector burk . o ’ shea ’ s assail had been warn in time to < br > scurri to cover befor the british parti had more than a fli glimps <

entir hi own . he < br > had plung into thi befog maze of circumst like a boy on a < br > holiday , and it wa for him to extric himself like a man . with the < br > warmest express of gratitud he part from inspector burk and the < br > naval lieuten , and hasten in the direct of the water-front . < br > < br > less than an hour later he wa inspect a light-draught steamer < br > call the _whang ho_ own by the china navig compani . she wa < br > old , sadli in need of repair , and about as sea-worthi for rough < br > weather as a packing-box . but o ’ shea felt confid that she could < br > be

onc , ” said o ’ shea , “ and if enough pressur < br > show on the gaug to turn her wheel as she lie at her moor , i < br > will sign the charter-parti and insur paper and slap down the two < br > thousand dollar for a month ’ s use of the vener relic. ” < br > < br > “ that is fair enough , ” repli the agent . “ and it is as good as done . < br > you can go ahead with get your suppli , captain

< br > “ charley tong sin ? well , rather . a smart chap , that. ” < br > < br > “ ye , veri . i wish i could keep my razor as sharp. ” < br > < br > captain o ’ shea next visit a ship-chandl ’ s and

ten thousand of them . the captain wa not a man to wag a foolish < br > tongu ; one could see it at a glanc . < br > < br > “ you and i might do busi some day , ” quoth o ’ shea , “ but i am too < br

sign articl in the afternoon . he believ the old irishman to be a < br > ripen scoundrel at hi own trade , but suspect him of no complic < br > in the manœuvr of charley tong sin . the comprador had mere use < br > paddi blake as a mean of make the acquaint of captain o ’ shea . < br > < br > five minut after noon the shipmast ( he had taken a decid dislik < br > to ride in ’ rickshaw ) trudg into the headquart build of < br > inspector burk . < br > < br > “ i have a choic collect for you to look over , ” said the latter . < br > “ they are wait in anoth room , and i should call them a

. “ i < br > should scarc call them desper charact . howev , while i wish < br > you the best of luck , old chap , i shall shed never a tear if you lose < br > your shipmat somewher beyond shanghai . let us call them soldier of < br > misfortun , if you like. ” < br > < br > he led the way into the larg drill-room , where a score or more of men < br > stood in uneasi attitud and appear not at all comfort in thi < br > environ . o ’ shea let hi glanc rove in swift , apprais scrutini < br > and smile to himself as he recogn one familiar type after anoth . < br > he had recruit such men as these for unostentati ventur in the < br > water of the spanish main . here wa the red-fac , burli shipmast < br > readi with a glib speech and fluent curs to explain how he happen < br > to be without hi paper ; the shambl ne ’ er-do-wel with the slack < br > mouth and the weak chin who had fled from a scrape at home to lose < br > himself in foreign port ; the tan adventur , brave and resourc , < br

who would sell hi soul for a < br > drink of brandi . < br > < br > these and the rest of them were seedi in variou way . they convey < br > a sens of failur , of have lost their grip . their cloth did not < br > signifi thi so much as what life had written in their face . sever , < br > in fact , were dress in clean white duck and linen . they were fight < br > hard to preserv the guis of self-respect . and yet everi man of them < br > had march to polic headquart at a word from inspector burk with < br > the sick fear in hi heart that hi past had overtaken him , or that he < br > wa to be deport for the good of the commun , or that he wa to be < br > lock up as a vagrant . < br > < br > inspector burk felt piti for them . it wa heartless to keep the poor < br > devil in thi pain suspens . with a curt nod he address them in < br > a group , for they had unwittingli drift togeth as if find some < br > small comfort in solidar . < br > < br > “ thi is not polic busi , ” said he . “ i sent for you to oblig my < br > friend captain o ’ shea . he will explain what he want , and i advis you < br > to play squar with him and i ’ m quit sure he will make it worth while. ” < br > < br > at thi the compani brighten and look immens reliev . the < br > hang-dog manner fled . shoulder were brace , head held erect . they < br > were like differ men . o ’ shea had a less pessimist opinion of < br > them . he had alreadi conclud to show no finicki tast by pick and < br > choos . he would take them in a lump , good , bad , and indiffer . < br > those who were realli compet would soon disclos it on shipboard and < br > they could help him hammer the other into shape . < br > < br > “ my speech to you will be short and sweet , ” said he . “ i need men for < br > a voyag coastwis and me steamer will be readi to sail to-night . you < br > will live well and i expect ye to obey order . ’ ti not sailor ’ work < br > or i should not take on your kind . the fewer question

among < br > themselv , as if afraid to make a slip that might break the spell . < br > captain o ’ shea had one thing more to say and they listen with the < br > most devout attent . < br > < br > “ i took note of the small hotel london down by the water-sid . ’ ti a < br > clean , decent place and i have had a word with the landlord . i will < br > give everi man me card . if you show it to him he will be pleas to < br > entertain ye at dinner at onc , and he will hand ye out cigar and < br > three drink apiec , no more . and i will meet you there for supper at < br > six o ’ clock to-night. ” < br > < br > “ excel strategi , ” murmur inspector burk . < br > < br > “ by the way , ” cri o ’ shea to hi pleas follow , “ i overlook < br > someth . i need a chief engin . can ani one of you qualifi ? ” < br > < br > it appear that none of them wa suffici acquaint with the < br > intern work of a steamer to pass as an expert , although a young man < br > of a veri cockney accent thought he might do as an assist . < br > < br > inspector burk made hast to remark : < br > < br > “ i say , let me give you the veri man for the job . kittridg is hi < br > name . it ’ s rather awkward , for he is in clink at present , the british < br > jail . but hi time expir to-morrow -- he wa given thirti day -- and i < br > dare say the magistr will be will to sign releas paper if i < br > explain the situation. ” < br > < br > “ i am not ask me men for refer , ” observ o ’ shea , “ but , as a < br > matter of mild curios , what did ye put thi kittridg away for ? ” < br > < br > “ he

pleas , and give him thi < br > card of mine , and tell him to wait for me there. ” < br > < br > through the afternoon captain michael o ’ shea , now master of the age < br > river steamer _whang ho_ , wa the busiest and most energet of men . a < br > hundr and one thing present themselv as necessari to be done . < br > when at length he hurri into the hotel london shortli befor the < br > supper-hour hi men were wait , hope , expect , cheer , smoke < br > hi cigar and with the three drink apiec tuck under their belt . < br > among them wa a lanki , solemn person with a pair of gray side-whisk < br > and a leatheri complexion crisscross by a net-work of fine wrinkl . < br > hi whole appear wa emin decor and respect and he < br > seem to have stray into the wrong compani . it wa not far-fetch < br > to conjectur that he might be a missionari from some station in the < br > chines hinterland who had kindli concern himself with the soul of < br > thi congreg of black sheep . <

< br > “ here is a river and coastwis pilot for ye that is as wise as < br > confuciu . and by the same token , i have no doubt that he wa onc < br > pilot aboard the junk of that grand old philosoph

the aggriev mr. kittridg wa to the effect that while < br > the engin of the _whang ho_ would probabl take her to sea without < br > break down , a night ’ s work on the condens , not to mention a leaki < br > cylind , would consider improv her health . captain o ’ shea told < br > him to drive ahead with these repair ; nor wa the delay worth fret < br > about . thing had gone amazingli well thu far and the _whang ho_ would < br > be readi to sail in the morn . he had no desir to spend anoth < br > night ashor , and he would take hi compani on board at onc , assign < br > them to quarter , and make a tent organ for sea duti . < br > < br > the _whang ho_ had been fit for passeng servic on the yang-ts , < br > and there were state-room on the upper deck to hold twice the number < br > of o ’ shea ’ s recruit . in the chines draft sent aboard by paddi blake < br > were a cook and a steward train to their busi , and they put < br > thing to right in their quiet , deft way . the mood of captain o ’ shea < br > becam normal cheer and confid . he had a deck under hi feet , < br > hi word wa law , and it wa good to hear the lap of salt water and the < br > swirl of the tide against a vessel ’ s side . < br > < br > he wa awak and about until midnight . the work in the engine-room wa < br > progress rapidli under the vehement direct of mr. kittridg . < br > feel the need of sleep , for the preced night had been a broken < br > one , captain o ’ shea set a watch in charg of the burli shipmast of < br > hi compani whom he appoint first mate and went to hi bunk in the < br > cabin just abaft the wheel-hous . at three o ’ clock mr. kittridg , < br > veri hot and grimi , rap on the door and gruffli announc that the < br > machinist had gone ashor and he propos to turn in and sleep until < br > sailing-tim . < br > < br > at six o ’ clock captain o ’ shea went on deck in hi pajama to order the < br > steward to fetch him a cup of coffe . he saw no reason whi the steamer < br > should not get under way at onc . the chines steward came not at hi < br > call and he betook himself to the galley . a fire wa burn in the < br > rang , rice and potato were cook in the pot , bacon slice on the < br > tabl readi for fri , but there wa no cook . o ’ shea look puzzl < br > and start for the forecastl . on the way he met hi first mate whose < br > demeanor wa distress and excit . < br > < br > “ i wa about to call you , sir , ” he exclaim , hi red face work with < br > emot . “ you will think i ’ ve made a hash of my first night on duti , < br > but thi insan busi happen like a shot out of a gun , sir . not < br > ten minut ago the chinamen , everi last one of ’ em , came boil on < br > deck and went over the side to the wharf like so mani rat . and they < br > never did stop run . they were scare ; it wa a panic ; but they < br > didn ’ t stop to jabber . they just flew , and most of ’ em left their < br > dunnag behind. ” < br > < br > “ the divil you say , ” mutter o ’ shea , and he rub hi head in < br > slightli bewild fashion . “ that must have been just befor i step < br > on deck , mr. parkinson . and ye have no idea at all what it wa about ? ” < br > < br > “ not the slightest , sir . i hope you don ’ t blame me . i ’ d have sail < br > into the thick of them with my fist , but it wa like chase so mani < br > greas pig . they vanish befor you could more than wink. ” < br > < br > “ what about the fire ? ” snap the captain . “ have you been below ? ” < br > < br > “ ye , sir . the first thing i did wa to find mr. kittridg . he is in < br > the engine-room , and he told me to send down half a dozen of our white < br > men to keep up steam. ” < br > < br > “ good enough ! now sing out for a volunt cook , and i will investig < br > thi comic perform . did anybodi get aboard to talk to these < br > chinamen ? ” < br > < br > “ not a soul , sir . i ’ m sure of it . i had a reliabl man at the gangway , < br > and anoth on the wharf. ” < br > < br > “ i believ you . while i look around a bit , get the ship readi to go < br > to sea , mr. parkinson . ’ ti not in me mind to be hung up in port veri < br > long. ” < br > < br > a sail junk wa attempt to reach with the morn breez across < br > the wide stretch of river . haul close to the wharf at which the < br > _whang ho_ wa moor , the junk attempt to come about , but miss < br > stay in lubberli fashion and hung in the wind as she slowli drift < br > past the steamer ’ s stern . the chines who clung to the long tiller , < br > and the other who stood upon the poop or haul on the cordag , were < br > gaze with sign of excit at the _whang ho_ . sever of them < br > gesticul , and their finger were aim at the round , overhang < br > stern of captain o ’ shea ’ s vessel . he caught sight of those antic and < br > walk aft . < br > < br > there wa no good reason whi the crew of the pass junk should < br > make such a fuss over thi commonplac river steamer . their singular < br > interest in her might be worth tri to fathom . without delay to < br > seek the gangway , he threw hi leg around a tauten hawser and slid < br > down to the wharf . run out to the end of it , he command a clear < br > view of the stern of the _whang ho_ . upon the white woodwork , just < br > abov the counter , wa paint in broad stroke of bright vermilion the < br > sprawl chines charact which had been gash in the back of the < br > sailor name jim eldridg . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea hastili return on board and climb over the after < br > rail , belay a loos end of heaving-lin and rest hi foot in the < br > loop so that he wa abl to let himself down until he could touch the < br > uppermost smear of vermilion paint . it rub off on hi hand , fresh < br > and wet , and must have been appli dure the night . hi chines crew < br > had discov it there . perhap some one had sung out the inform < br > from a pass junk or sampan . at ani rate , thi wa what had made them < br > quit the steamer . a charg of dynamit could have made their exodu < br > no more expediti . the word had flown from mouth to mouth , and they < br > fled from the ship as from the plagu . even the incred age pilot < br > had hobbl away with the rest of them , fear restor an agil long < br > sinc depart . < br > < br > “ the hoodoo again ! ” reflect exclaim o ’ shea . “ i thought i had got < br

guess , and ’ ti as good < br > as the next one. ” < br > < br > he would find paddi blake at onc and discuss the matter with him . < br > perhap he could ship anoth crew and leav port befor the news had < br > time to spread among the chines seafar . tell mr. parkinson to < br > see to it that the vermilion paint wa instantli remov , he set out < br > on foot along the water-front . at thi earli hour , there wa no stir < br > of busi among the foreign shipping-hous . pass a substanti < br > brick build , captain o ’ shea ’ s eye wa held for an instant by the < br > brass sign on one of the door , “ jordan , margetson & co. ” he happen < br > to be think quit assidu just then of the courteou comprador , < br > charley tong sin . he halt and stare hard at the door in front of him < br > which wa ajar . < br > < br > it wa too earli for ani of the clerk to be about . with an impuls < br > which had no definit purpos behind it , captain o ’ shea push open < br > the door and quietli

< br > < br > “ i expect to sail by now , but there ha been a bit of troubl with me < br > nativ crew , ” repli the shipmast , wari as a hawk . “ i saw your place < br > wa open and i drop in on the

ingenu featur express not the slightest chang of < br > emot , but in an instant he had discov that which clinch < br > and drove home hi suspicion of charley tong sin . the comprador put < br > a fresh cigarett to hi lip and held a light match between hi < br > finger , unawar that the flare convey a fleet transluc . < br > underneath the beauti polish nail of hi thumb and forefing < br > there show a line of vermilion which the most care scrub had < br > fail to erad . it wa the color of the paint which had been < br > smear on the stern of the _whang ho_ in the form of a sprawl < br

plausibl , the purpos hot in hi heart to find a < br > pretext that should coax the comprador to accompani him on board the < br > _whang ho_ . to a sympathet queri captain o ’ shea smoothli made answer : < br > < br > “ i am the kind of a man that will own up to hi own mistak . i thought < br > i could go it alon when i ought to have been glad and thank for < br > the help of a man like yourself . between us , i am not anxiou to go to < br > sea in thi old tub that i have charter from the china navig < br > compani . and now that i am delay for lack of a crew , mayb you can < br > show me a way to slip out of the bargain . my chief engin find the < br > vessel is not at all what she wa repres to be . i took her subject < br > to certain condit and she can not make good. ” < br

< br > < br > “ that i will do , and gladli , ” affirm o ’ shea . “ have ye time to step < br > aboard with me now and i will show you how i have been bunco . then ye < br > can advis me how to break the charter . i have a good case. ” < br > < br > “ of cours i will , ” cri the comprador . “ pooh , we will bluff the china < br > navig compani out of it boot . i will make them look like thirti <

and be turn adrift becaus he had < br > fail to prevent the desert of the crew , brighten percept at < br > sight of charley tong sin and conclud that thi influenti young man < br > had been persuad to mend the troubl . < br > < br > “ come to my room , if ye pleas , ” said captain o ’ shea to the smile < br > comprador , “ and i will summon my chief engin . he will tell you that < br > the steamer is not fit to make three knot an hour , and then we will go < br > below. ” < br > < br > the shipmast beckon mr. parkinson to follow . the trio were pass < br > through the wide hall of the main cabin when captain o ’ shea halt . < br > swing on hi heel , he stood face charley tong sin , who start < br > slightli , for the visag of captain o ’ shea wa stern and lower . < br > < br > what follow wa instantan . the shipmast ’ s fist shot out and < br > collid with the jaw of the comprador , who measur hi length on the < br > floor and appear to be wrap in slumber . onli the toe of hi

“ take him by the < br > heel while i carri the other end of him and we will lock him in a < br > spare state-room . put a guard over him . if he squeal , hit him again < br > and keep him quiet. ” <

“ you can make your choic , mr. parkinson . ye sail with me and you play < br > my game or you can go ashor to rot and starv on the beach , same as < br > when i pick ye out of the gutter . i have given thi dirti young < br > chines blackguard a tast of what is come to him . will ye fall to or < br > shall i kick you out of the ship ? ” < br > < br > “ i -- i will take your order , sir , ” stammer the other . < br > < br > “ then help me get thi steamer to sea . we will wait for no more chines < br > sailor . muster all hand on the upper deck. ” < br > < br > they came pile up from the hold and the dining-room abaft the galley , < br > where most of them had been at breakfast . the inanim comprador wa < br > no longer visibl . < br > < br > “ will you sail with me at onc or lose the chanc of make the < br > voyag ? ” demand o ’ shea . “ some of you will have to shovel coal and < br > other wash dish and do seamen ’ s duti on deck . but i will pay ye < br > extra for it , and we will take thi old box of a steamer to where we < br > want to go. ” < br > < br > the respons wa hearti and unanim . the adventur could think of < br > no wors fate than to be onc more strand in shanghai . they were well < br > fed , they had slept in clean bed again , and their employ wa a man < br > who could be trust to deal with them fairli . with a spirit cheer < br > they scatter to their variou station . the chief engin spoke < br > briefli , hi gray whisker stand out in the morn breez : < br > < br > “ nobodi but a wild irishman would have the nerv to take thi paint < br >

let go , fore and aft , ” roar the master . “ are ye pilot enough to < br > take her down the river , mr. parkinson ? ” < br > < br > “ i could do it with both eye shut , but i ’ m not so familiar with the < br > coast to the north ’ ard. ” < br > < br > “ i have a pilot for the part of the coast and the river we are bound < br > for , ” grimli return o ’ shea . “ he is lock in a spare state-room just < br > now . he will know that part of china veri well , for ’ ti me opinion < br > that he ha been there before. ” < br > < br > < br > v < br > < br > over a mourn , muddi expans of the china sea wallow a top-heavi < br > river steamer whose engin rais protest clamor like an assemblag < br > of threshing-machin . the god of the air and water were in a kindli < br > mood or els she would have open up and founder ere now . in the < br > spray-swept wheel-hous stood captain michael o ’ shea , sway easili < br > to the crazi roll and lurch of the _whang ho_ and scan the low dim < br > coast with a pair of glass . cling to the window ledg besid him < br > wa a young man of a chines counten whose raiment , the handiwork < br > of a fashion british tailor , wa sadli rumpl and soil . the < br > whole aspect of the young man wa rumpl , in fact , not to say < br > excess forlorn , and now and then he press hi hand against a < br > pain jaw . it wa difficult to imagin that he had been an ornament < br > of club , a pattern for the gild youth , and the smartest comprador < br > between tientsin and singapor . < br > < br > the plight of charley tong sin wa made poignantli distress by the < br > fact that in the process of acquir the vice of the occid he < br > had lost hi grip on the essenti virtu of the orient . hi nativ < br > stoicism had been sap and the fatalist attitud of mind which < br > meet death without so much as the flutter of an eyelid wa eaten with < br > dry-rot . in other word , the comprador wa will to pay ani price to < br > save hi own skin , although hi father befor him would have suffer < br > himself to be slice to death by inch sooner than “ lose face ” in the < br > presenc of a foreign . < br > < br > captain michael o ’ shea ’ s method of extract inform from thi < br > kidnap passeng had been brutal simpl and direct . charley tong < br > sin wa inform that he could make a clean breast of it or be thrown < br > overboard . and the shipmast , when he wa thoroughli in earnest , had a < br > way of convey the impress that he meant what he said . he believ < br > that he knew hi man . the comprador wa strongli reluct to have hi < br > head lop off by the sword of a nativ execution , which wa veri < br > like to happen if thi terribl o ’ shea should turn him over to the < br > chines author . given the promis of immun in exchang for a < br > confess , he could flee to japan or the strait settlement and < br > live handsom in the societi of other chines exil with the fund < br > that he had pile up dure hi brief and brilliant busi career . < br > likewis there would be opportun in ship and commerc for a < br > comprador of hi uncommon abil . < br > < br > “ i would honestli enjoy kill you , charley , ” said captain o ’ shea as < br > they stood togeth in the wheel-hous of the _whang ho_ . “ you are a < br > smart lad , but ye got too gay with me , and you overplay your game < br > when ye slip under the counter of thi steamer in a sampan in the < br > dark of the night and got busi with the red paint . that sort of silli < br > juggleri wa the chines of it , i suppos . now , i have tri to make it <

the countri if they have the < br > price in their pocket , and i will give them the price . so ye must not < br > hold to the notion that we are afraid of get in troubl on your < br > account. ” < br

deuc of a lot of think . i am < br > no fool , captain o ’ shea . i know pretti well when i am lick . i made a < br > botch of it in shanghai . you went blunder about like a buffalo , and < br > i thought it wa a cinch to get you out of the way. ” < br > < br > “ ’ twa the luck of the irish that pull me through , ” said o ’ shea . “ now < br > we understand each other , charley , me lad . i am stake all i have -- me < br > life and me money -- to get to the bottom of thi infern secret societi < br > you have mix yourself up with . ’ ti an instrument i am for the good < br > of human . and if ye turn state ’ s evid to enabl me to make a < br > clean , thorough job of it , i think i am justifi in give you a < br > chanc to hot-foot it out of china. ” < br > < br > “ let us call it a bargain , captain o ’ shea . as we use to say in new < br > york , i am up against it good and plenti . to commit suicid , as mani < br > chines would do in a fix like thi , is all tommy-rot . charley tong sin < br > could have no more gin cocktail -- what ? ” < br > < br > “ you can begin the confess right away , ” exclaim the shipmast . < br > < br > “ one thing at a time , ” cheer repli the comprador . “ i will < br > take you to the river of ten thousand evil smell and the villag of < br > wang-li-fu . then you will find mani veri interest thing to ask me < br > to talk about. ” < br > < br > “ and ye hope to give me the slip in the meantim , ” and captain o ’ shea < br > show no ill-wil . “ veri well , charley . one thing at a time . now take < br > these glass and have a look at the coast . by my reckon , we are far < br > enough to the north ’ ard to begin to haul inshore. ” < br > < br > the _whang ho_ wa labor abeam of a monoton expans of marshi < br > island and rag shoal made by the silt of river flood . the < br > shift channel were poorli chart , for trade sought the inland < br > water-way . the fact that the _tai yan_ steamer , with mcdougal and jim < br > eldridg on board , had somehow found a passag lead from the sea < br > convinc captain o ’ shea that he could do likewis with a consider < br > smaller vessel . charley tong sin had admit that he knew the way in , < br > and he wa no more anxiou to be drown than the rest of the compani . < br > < br > “ with good luck we can scrape over the sandbar on the afternoon tide , ” < br > said the comprador , “ and anchor in deep water for the night . i can not < br > show you where to go in the dark . there are no lights. ” < br > < br > the _whang ho_ edg steadili nearer the coast . her crew gaze ahead at < br > the froth breaker that tumbl over the far-extend shoal , and < br > appear unhappi . by a miracl their steamer wa still under them after < br > struggl through rough wind and high sea , and now they were to be < br > wreck , so all sign indic , in a god-forsaken region of sand and < br > swamp and mud . howev , there wa no whimper . captain o ’ shea , their < br > overlord , had a trick of knock a man down and then listen to hi < br > complaint . and he wa as readi with a word of commend as he wa < br > with hi disciplinari fist . < br > < br > “ mr . kittridg , if we hit bottom , put it to her and jam her over , ” < br > he remark to the chief engin . “ a chum of mine by the name of < br > johnni kent that sail with me and held your berth use to clamp hi < br > safety-valv when he had urgent need of steam . did ye ever tri it ? ” < br > < br > “ god forbid ! ” fervent ejacul mr. kittridg ; “ but in thi crazi < br > tub a man will do anyth . if you find yourself flyin ’ to glori with < br > a section of a boiler pokin ’ in the small of your back , don ’ t lay it < br > against me , sir. ” < br > < br > “ i like the way ye talk , mr. kittridg . stand by your engin , if ye < br > pleas , for we will be in the white water befor long. ” < br > < br > the _whang ho_ sheer to one side and shoulder past the outermost < br > shoal . o ’ shea took the wheel , and charley tong sin , cool and < br > quick-wit , told him how to follow the turbid , twist channel that < br > wound it cours between the sea and the wide mouth of the estuari . < br > more than onc the steamer scrape the oozi bottom , hung and shiver < br > while the breaker pound her , and then stubbornli forg ahead , < br > timber groan , boiler hiss , propel kick up cloud of mud < br > astern . it wa evid that the channel had shoal in place sinc ani < br > other steamer had made the passag , and it wa not at all certain that < br > the _whang ho_ could stand the strain of forc her way to sea again . < br > < br > “ i have not been here sinc two year ago , ” said the comprador . “ it is < br > wors than i expect , you bet ! ai oh , a man that sail with you die a < br > dozen death , captain o ’ shea. ” < br > < br > “ i find it more comfort than live in the best hotel in shanghai , ” < br > veri pointedli return the shipmast as he climb the spoke of the < br > big wooden wheel with hand and feet and wrench the _whang ho_ clear < br > of a hungri sand-spit . by now she wa fairli in the midst of the marshi < br > island that extend from the wateri main-land . the violenc of the < br > surf wa broken and the tide move in broad , sluggish current . mr. < br > parkinson , who wa swing the sound lead , shout that the channel < br > had deepen to five fathom . the steamer had surviv the passag . < br > < br > two mile farther inland she let go anchor in a wide lagoon . the < br > afternoon had wane . a cloudi twilight wa close down . on everi hand < br > stretch a flat , unbroken region of swamp and creek and river . no < br > villag were visibl nor grove of tree against the sky-lin to mark < br > the situat of a templ . a few small fishing-boat with rag sail < br > fled at sight of the foreign steamer . the comprador wave hi hand to < br > starboard and exclaim : < br > < br > “ yonder it is , the river of ten thousand evil smell , as you call it < br > in english . wait till the tide goe down , and you will find out pretti < br > quick whi the chines give it that funni name. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti a filthy-look countri , ” quoth captain o ’ shea . “ it look like < br > one great big sewer , with the yellow water and the sludg and the slime < br > on the banks. ” < br > < br > “ it wa all veri well drain one time , long ago , ” explain charley < br > tong sin . “ then there were mani peopl and town . the tai ping < br > destroy the canal and play the dicken with everyth . and < br > noth ha been repair , so the peopl don ’ t live here ani more. ” < br > < br > “ and where is thi place call wang-li-fu ? ” demand o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ six mile up that stink river . you think you will see the paint < br > joss to-morrow , captain ? ” < br > < br > “ the stink river and the paint joss ! you are loosen up , < br > charley . i am near the end of me journey when you say thing like that . < br > i have heard of them before. ” < br > < br > “ two other foreign men -- onli two -- have seen the paint joss , and it < br > wa unfortun for them. ” the comprador said thi softli and with an < br > evil grin . he had overstep the mark . captain o ’ shea grip him by < br > the neck and shook him savag as he thunder in hi ear : < br > < br > “ ani more of that , and i will forget the bargain we made . one of those < br > men wa a friend of mine , and by right i ought to drill ye with a < br > bullet as a favor to him. ” < br > < br > between chatter teeth charley tong sin , suddenli abject , beg for < br > hi life . present he move restlessli from one deck to anoth , but < br > alway a man follow and kept watch of him , as captain o ’ shea had < br > order . the ship ’ s compani , most of them off duti and weari with the < br > stress and hardship of the voyag , gather under an awn stretch < br > between the deck-hous and talk in low tone . thi melancholi , empti < br > landscap had a qualiti curious depress . with the fall tide the < br > swamp and the muddi bank were laid bare and the air becam foul and < br > heavi with the smell of decay veget , of ooz , of dead fish . the < br > ebb and flow of salt-wat fail to cleans and sweeten these sluggish < br > stream and stagnant lagoon and abandon canal . < br > < br > the men who had follow captain o ’ shea to thi place were no longer < br > so mani vagabond and failur struggl for surviv . they had been < br > weld togeth , in a way . they were an organ with someth < br > like _esprit de corps_ and could be depend on to act as a unit . < br > such a feel as thi bring to life dead self-respect and shatter < br > confid . they knew not at all what the morrow might bring forth , but < br > everi one of them wa anxiou to play the man , to stand the test , to < br > redeem himself in hi own sight , to justifi captain o ’ shea ’ s faith in < br > him . < br > < br > it wa not a night to invit sleep . the adventur felt the immens < br > loneli of thi loathsom anchorag . it wa unlik the popul < br > china which they had hitherto known . one might believ , with the < br > nativ , that ghost and demon had power to curs and blast a region < br > in which some violat of the _fung-shui_ , or sacr rite of wind and < br > water , had anger the supernatur influenc . the breez die to a < br > dead calm . the lifeless air reek with the stench from the mouth of < br > the river of ten thousand evil smell . < br > < br > it wa draw toward midnight when mr. kittridg came on deck and said < br > to captain o ’ shea , who wa sit with a group of hi men : < br > < br > “ i shall have to start the pump , sir . the vessel is leakin ’ much wors < br > than when i first report it. ” < br > < br > “ um-m , i wa hope we could lay her on a beach after we have finish < br > our busi up the river and calk her plate , ” repli the master of < br > the _whang ho_ . “ is she make water faster than you can handl it , < br > mr. kittridg ? ” < br > < br > “ she act to me as if a plate drop clean out of her a few minut < br > ago , sir . the pump may help , but i have a notion that the whole < br > rotten , blanketi river is runnin ’ into her. ” < br > < br > captain o ’ shea jump below and wa promptli convinc that the gloomi < br > diagnosi of the chief engin had a larg basi of fact . the water < br > wa fairli rush into the hold and gurgl over the ballast . like < br > enough , the batter passag in from sea had shear and wrench away < br > enough rusti rivet to weaken the junction of two or more plate , and < br > they had been unabl ani longer to withstand the pressur . it realli < br > made no differ whether or not thi theori wa the correct one . the < br > fact wa that the vener _whang ho_ had suddenli decid to lay < br > her bone in the mud with six fathom of water abov her keel . mr. < br > kittridg pensiv caress hi gray whisker and remark with a sigh : < br > < br > “ i mention the pump from forc of habit . it ’ s realli ridicul to < br > stay below ani longer , captain . we gave the bloodi old tub more than < br > she could stand , and she ’ s peac chuck it up . she ’ s sinkin ’ veri < br > quiet and decent , i ’ ll say that for her. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti time we said good-bi to her , ” quoth o ’ shea . “ draw your fire , if < br > you can , mr. kittridg , and i will get the boat ready. ” < br > < br > “ i do seem to find troubl wherev i go , ” sadli murmur the chief < br > engin . < br > < br > the men on deck took the news with no great show of excit . thi < br > wa the kind of voyag which one could not reason expect to be < br > commonplac . to have to escap from a sink steamer wa an episod , < br > not a disast . in few word , captain o ’ shea assur them that he had < br > no intent of let thi uncomfort littl happen interfer < br > with the busi for which he had employ them . the insur < br > underwrit would be out of pocket , but who care a rap for them , < br > anyhow ? thereupon he issu order , swiftli , intellig , with < br > master vehem . the two boat which appear most servic < br > were swung outboard and held readi to launch . they would hold a dozen < br > men each without crowd . water-keg were fill , the galley and < br > store-room ransack for tin of meat and biscuit , bag of potato < br > and rice . the fire-arm and cutlass were serv out and the case < br > of ammunit divid between the two boat . meanwhil the _whang ho_ < br > continu to sink with a certain digniti and decorum . one could find < br > noth dramat in thi shipwreck . everi one move with hast , but < br > there wa no outcri . < br > < br > onli one mischanc mar the exodu from the _whang ho_ . all hand < br > were absorb , and quit natur , in delay their departur as < br > littl as possibl . delay meant someth wors than wet feet . in fact , < br > the main deck wa almost level with the water when the boat were readi < br > to shove clear . for onc the _whang ho_ had move rapidli , although < br > in a lament direct . with so much to do in so short a time , it < br > wa not extraordinari that the vigil espionag which surround < br > charley tong sin should be relax , not to say forgotten , for a moment . < br > even captain o ’ shea neglect to keep an eye on him , the busi of < br > abandon ship on a dark night at excess short notic be < br > calcul to tax the resourc of the most capabl command . < br > < br > the comprador took advantag of these distract to eras himself < br > from the scene . the boat were held against the side of the steamer , < br > while the captain took talli of the men in them , scrambl from one < br > boat to the other with a globe lantern swing in hi fist . charley < br > tong sin wa indubit miss . o ’ shea leap on board the moribund < br > _whang ho_ , which wa now sob and gurgl tremend , and made < br > a fli search of the cabin and state-room . it wa obviou that < br > thi elus young chines had not vanish below deck , where by now < br > noth but a fish could exist . and unless captain michael o ’ shea < br > wish to join the fish , it wa time for him to go . < br > < br > chagrin and anxiou , he return to hi boat , and the men frantic < br > pli oar . a moment or two later the _whang ho_ went under with veri < br > littl fuss , meet her end with the calm of a chines philosoph . < br > the boat rock in the wave that roll away from the place where she < br > had been , and the ray of the lantern reveal mani larg and greasi < br > bubbl . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea wast no time in sentiment regret . the _whang ho_ < br > wa a dead issu . what vital concern him wa the whereabout of < br > that valuabl passeng , charley tong sin . it wa absurd to suppos < br > that he had fallen overboard and given up the ghost . a rascal of hi < br > kidney had as mani live as a cat . it wa much more plausibl to < br > surmis that he had unostentati laid hold of a life-belt , slip < br > over the stern , and made for the nearest shore . the boat move to < br > and fro , look for him , but the dark , misti and opaqu , made it < br > hopeless to discov the head of a swimmer who by thi time might have < br > left the water and conceal himself in the marsh . < br > < br > “ i misdoubt that me polici wa sound , ” said captain o ’ shea to mr. < br > kittridg . “ mayb i ought to have shot him , anyhow. ” < br > < br > “ it would ha ’ been a good job , ” grunt the chief engin . “ and now < br > he ’ ll streak it for thi villag of wang-li-fu and give an alarm. ” < br > < br > “ precis that . but unless he can pick up a sampan or a fishing-boat < br > he will make slow headway flounderin ’ through the swamp and swim < br > the creek . ’ ti up to us to beat him to it. ” < br > < br > mr. parkinson , who wa in command of the other boat , wa order to < br > steer alongsid for consult . it wa promptli agre that the parti < br > should first find the mouth of the river of ten thousand evil smell < br > and then move up-stream without delay . it would be slow and blunder < br > navig , but if three or four mile could be travers befor < br > daylight they might tie up to the bank and reconnoitr within strike < br > distanc of their goal . < br > < br > “ i do not know what kind of a mess we will hop into , ” o ’ shea told them < br > befor the boat separ . “ we may have to fight our way , thank < br > to that slipperi divil of a comprador , and i am not ask ye to go < br > anywher that i will not go meself . some of you are not train to use < br > weapon , but if ye will cut loos and blaze away and not think too much < br > about your own skin , we can make it uncomfort for a slather of < br > chines . there is plenti of ammunit , so don ’ t scrimp yourselves. ” < br > < br > the boat slid slowli into the entranc of the wide , sluggish stream . < br > the lantern were extinguish . the onli sound wa the cadenc < br > thump of the thole-pin . if ani of the men felt the prickli chill of < br > cowardic , they kept it to themselv . now and then the keel furrow < br > the mud , and when the boat strand hard and fast , the crew wade < br > overboard and shove them ahead . thu the littl flotilla progress < br > until dawn flush the eastern sky and the vapor , stream upward < br > from the marsh , curl and drift like filmi cloud . higher ground < br > and the green , checker squar of till field were discern a < br > short distanc beyond . < br > < br > the boat turn into the mouth of a tini creek where the tall rush < br > curtain them from observ . thi wa a favor halt place , < br > and a cold breakfast wa hastili eaten . o ’ shea had a poor opinion < br > of fight on an empti stomach . he address himself with mark < br > defer to a veri neatli dress man with iron-gray hair who had said < br > littl dure the voyag . hi face wa haggard and hi eye were tire < br > with weari of live . < br > < br > “ you have seen servic , sir , and ye have led drill men , ” said o ’ shea . < br > “ the card are dealt , but from now on you can play them better than i . < br > i will be oblig to ye for advice. ” < br > < br > the cashier offic look grate . thi kind of recognit had < br > power to move him . with a diffid manner , as if hi profession < br > opinion had long sinc ceas to interest ani one , he repli : < br > < br > “ most chines villag are wall . there will be at least one gate < br > face the river and two or three on the inland side . it is often < br > awkward to make a land under fire from boat . i suggest we divid < br > our forc . if you approv , captain , i will take ten of the most activ < br > men and disembark here . we can fetch a wide circuit of the town , and < br > it will not be difficult to make our way across the rice field and < br > ditch . you can put the rest of them in one boat and row up in front < br > of the town , wait in the stream until we are in a posit to make a < br > rush . then we will drive home a simultan attack in front and rear. ” < br > < br > “ napoleon could not beat it , ” heartili exclaim o ’ shea . “ and if ye < br > shoot fast enough and kick up a terribl racket , they will think ye are < br > an armi . what will the signal be ? ” < br > < br > “ three rifl shots. ” < br > < br > “ ay , ay , mr. bannist . ’ ti the sensibl plan that ye take command of < br > the armi while i hoist the rear-admir ’ s pennant over the navi . we < br > have no reserv , but mani a famou victori would have been miss < br > from histori if the lad that won them had wait for the reserv to < br > come up. ” < br > < br > the chosen ten forsook the boat and tramp off behind their soldierli < br > leader . a few minut later the expedit of captain o ’ shea got < br > under way , hi boat hug the muddi shore and dodg behind it < br > rag indent . it wa not long befor a wide curv of the river < br > disclos to view the tile roof , the crumbl brick wall , and the < br > tower gate-way of a villag . in front of it were sever ricketi < br > wharf , or stage , built of bamboo pole lash togeth . at the < br > outer end of one of these lay a two-mast junk , her hawse-hol < br > paint to resembl two huge eye . the tide had begun to ebb , and the < br > junk wa alreadi heel so that her deck slope toward the river . thi < br > craft appear to be desert . no pigtail head bob behind the < br > immens heavi bulwark . if the armi offic had been a napoleon , < br > captain o ’ shea show himself a nelson . < br > < br > “ pull like blaze for the junk yonder , ” he shout to hi men . “ we will < br > pile aboard her and take cover. ” < br > < br > the junk wa directli in front of the gate-way in the villag wall , < br > and perhap a hundr yard distant from it . the interven space < br > wa beach , a miri roadway , and a disorderli row of shanti made of < br > drift-wood , with a few boat haul out for repair . the heavi timber < br > of the junk made her a nautic fortress , and the high side would be < br > difficult of direct assault . < br > < br > the men swung lustili at the oar , and the boat shot out into the open < br > river . o ’ shea steer wide of the villag until he could turn and make < br > directli for the junk . it wa an admir bit of strategi , but wholli < br > wast on thi sleepi , shabbi chines villag . there wa never a sign < br > of a hostil demonstr . as an anticlimax the thing wa absurd . a < br > crowd of men , women , and children stream out through the gate in the < br > wall and stare with much excit chatter at the foreign invad . < br > appar their behavior meant no more than a harmless curios . < br > sever garrul old gentlemen squat upon fragment of timber < br > and pull at their bamboo pipe while they discuss the singular < br > visit with the oracular demeanor of so mani owl . < br > < br > the bold o ’ shea grin sheepishli . hi sensat were those of a man < br > who beheld a heroic enterpris suddenli turn into low comedi . he < br > glanc at the amus face of hi follow and said : < br > < br > “ ’ ti not what ye might call a desper resist . let us promenad < br > ashor and look the town over. ” < br > < br > they quit their fortress and move along the narrow , sway stage < br > of bamboo , their rifl readi for use in the event of an ambuscad . the < br > chines crowd promptli retreat in noisi confus . o ’ shea order < br > a halt . after some delay , three signal shot came down the wind from < br > major bannist ’ s forc . he wa about to attack the villag from the < br > landward side . now the shopkeep and cooli scuttl madli away < br > from o ’ shea ’ s parti to seek shelter within the wall and discov what < br > all thi extraordinari excit could mean . < br > < br > behind them tramp the naval brigad into street from which the < br > inhabit were vanish as rapidli as possibl . somewher near the < br > centr of the town o ’ shea and major bannist join forc . thi pair < br > of valiant leader eye each other with mutual puzzl chagrin . < br > < br > “ we just walk in without the slightest troubl , ” confess the armi < br > man . “ what do you make of it ? ” < br > < br > “ i had the same experi , ” observ o ’ shea . “ and i do not know what < br > to make of it at all . ’ twa me firm convict that we were prancin ’ < br > into a hornet ’ s nest . the inform all point that way . i would < br > call it a funni kind of a surpris party. ” < br > < br > “ the villag have no intent of make it unpleas for us . they < br > have been give my men egg and melon and chicken , to keep us < br > good-natur , i presume. ” < br > < br > “ well , we will find quarter and fetch our grub from the junk , and i < br > will buy the drink , if ye can locat them , for the joke seem to be on < br > me. ” < br > < br > they found the villag tavern , consist of sever detach build < br > set in a larg court-yard . the agit landlord kow-tow himself < br > almost black in the face , and in trembl accent express hi < br > desir to bestow all hi good upon the warlik foreign if onli < br > hi miser life might be spare . he summarili eject a few nativ < br > guest of low degre , who fled without delay to argu the matter . < br > the invad set the tavern cooli to sweep and scrub the < br > filthi build and took charg of the kitchen with it row of earthen < br > fire-pot . there wa no lack of room for men to sleep three and four in < br > a row upon the _k ’ angs_ , or brick platform use for the purpos , and < br > the rag quilt were hung outsid to air . in short , the tavern wa < br > transform into a camp which had no seriou discomfort . < br > < br > have taken care of hi men , captain o ’ shea found leisur to ponder < br > over the situat , a process which left him with a headach . he < br > rambl unmolest from one end of the villag to the other , search < br > for clue that might link themselv with the paint joss and the < br > tragedi of bill maguir . there were two small , dilapid templ , one < br > of them inhabit by a few buddhist priest in yellow robe . o ’ shea wa < br > permit to enter them and explor to hi heart ’ s content . they were < br > noth more than villag shrine , howev , in which the perfunctori < br > rite were held and offer made -- such place as might have been seen < br > in a thousand chines town . nor did the villag itself , except for < br > an air of gener decay , differ from the hamlet of a dozen provinc . < br > < br > “ i have a harrow suspicion that charley tong sin made a monkey of < br > me , ” ruefulli sigh o ’ shea , “ or mayb i have been all wrong from the < br > start . the chines proposit ha too mani twist in it for a white < br > man to fathom. ” < br > < br > as a person of consider confid in hi abil to master < br > difficulti , hi self-esteem had been dealt a hard blow . hi < br > imagin had pictur a larg , stir climax of hi pilgrimag , < br > and here he wa all adrift in a wretch littl villag of no < br > consequ whatev , the last place in the world to find the < br > headquart of a secret organ so mysteri power as < br > to cast it sinist shadow throughout china , and even across the < br > sea . and yet the evid had been by no mean vagu and mislead . < br > begin with the fragmentari revel of the dement sailor , < br > come next to the disclosur of poor mcdougal ’ s diari , he had been < br > led straight to the town of wang-li-fu , on the river of ten thousand < br > evil smell . he had felt that the hand of destini wa guid him . < br > < br > return to the tavern yard o ’ shea found hi men cheer make < br > friend of the villag and accept the situat with the readi < br > adapt of true soldier of fortun . they look to the leader < br > for order , but he had none to give them . he had been place in the < br > ridicul posit of provid wage and ration for a perfectli < br > superflu expeditionari forc . < br > < br > “ just what did you expect to turn up in thi pigsti of a settlement ? ” < br > gloomili inquir mr. kittridg , who seem disappoint that he had < br > not broken a few head . “ whatev it wa , it fell flat. ” < br > < br > “ it did that , ” frankli admit o ’ shea . “ ’ ti a pain subject , mr. < br > kittridg , and we will not discuss it now . but i am not done with the < br > riddl of wang-li-fu. ” < br > < br > three day pass , and singli and in squad the invad ransack the < br > villag and it suburb , poke into shop , alley , dwell , and < br > court-yard and take stock of the inmat thereof . that the peopl < br > were veri poor and veri industri wa all that one could say of them . < br > and they were no more to be suspect of plot deed of violenc < br > than so mani rabbit . doggedli persist , unwil to confess himself < br > beaten , o ’ shea shift hi quest to the open countri for mile outsid < br > of wang-li-fu . it wa a region of green field gridiron with ditch < br > and rut path , and dot with toiler in blue cotton blous and < br > straw hat , who till their crop from dawn to dark . < br > < br > it wa obvious useless to extend the investig ani consider < br > distanc away from thi region . if the secret wa not to be unearth < br > in the vicin of wang-li-fu , then hi conclus had been all wrong . < br > the villag assur him that thi wa , in truth , none other than < br > wang-li-fu , and the baffl , perplex o ’ shea could not let go of the < br > opinion that the goal wa somewher near at hand . otherwis , whi all < br > the elabor stratagem in shanghai to thwart hi voyag to the river < br > of ten thousand evil smell ? < br > < br > he had imagin himself attack a stronghold of some sort , a < br > headquart of desper crimin who must be wipe out . but if that < br > slipperi comprador charley tong sin had carri a warn to the men of < br > the paint joss , he must have fled elsewher than to thi commonplac , < br > harmless villag . at ani rate , it seem absurd to tarri much longer < br > in wang-li-fu with a forc of arm retain . < br > < br > at the end of a fortnight , o ’ shea wa of the opinion that hi loyal < br > legion had better seek to mend it fortun in some other quarter . he < br > wa asham to look them in the face . the fiasco cut him to the quick . < br > he had been as mad as poor bill maguir . in futur he would stick to < br > hi trade as a shipmast . < br > < br > meanwhil , the malari poison of the marsh found it way into hi < br > blood . he fail to realiz that he wa ill , and paid no attent to < br > the littl flash of fever that came by night and the creep , chilli < br > feel that troubl him in the morn . < br > < br > there came a day when he wa unabl to rise from the brick < br > sleeping-platform . the fever increas , suddenli , violent . it caught < br > him unprepar . hi plan of retreat had not been announc , and now he < br > wa incap of leadership . hi mind altern between delirium and < br > stupor . when he talk it wa of mani inconsequenti thing . one might < br > have said that the evil spirit of the paint joss had laid it spell < br > of misfortun upon him . in the court-yard of the tavern hi lieuten < br > held a confer . < br > < br > “ can anybodi make head or tail of thi infern situat ? ” gloomili < br > inquir mr. kittridg . “ what in hade are we go to do about it ? ” < br > < br > “ tri to pull captain o ’ shea through thi fever befor we think of < br > anyth els , ” stoutli affirm mr. parkinson . “ we jam into thi < br > crazi voyag with our eye shut . with all of us it wa anyth to get < br > clear of shanghai . and it ’ s useless busi to sit and growl about it < br > as hard luck . what do you say , major bannist ? ” < br > < br > the armi man smile at sight of their discourag counten and < br > quietli answer : < br > < br > “ what els can we chap expect but hard luck ? realli , i should be < br

captain o ’ shea with us . if < br > we don ’ t , he will die as sure as sunris , and the rest of us will be < br > down with it befor long . it caught him first becaus he wa fag < br > with worry. ” < br > < br > “ we agre with you there , ” said mr. parkinson . “ but we seem to have < br > overlook a line of retreat . that wa the irish of it , i suppos . if < br > we go down river in our two boat we ’ ll have to work ’ em out to sea < br > over those nasti shoal and then run the chanc of be pick up < br > adrift . we might get away with it , but it would kill a man as sick as < br > o ’ shea. ” < br > < br > “ whi not go up-riv ? ” suggest major bannist . “ by mean of a few < br > word of chines and a great mani gestur i have extract from the < br > villag head-men the inform that there is a european mission < br > station about a hundr and fifti mile northwest of here . we can make < br > part of the journey by boat and then hike overland . with a litter and < br > cooli to carri it , we may be abl to take captain o ’ shea through < br > aliv . it ’ s better than let him die in thi pest-hole. ” < br > < br > “ that ’ s the most sensibl speech i ’ ve heard sinc we sign on , ” < br > grunt mr. kittridg . “ and you can pull out of thi rotten wang-li-fu < br > not a minut too soon to pleas me. ” < br > < br > the villag head-men were summon , and these vener worthi < br > declar themselv anxiou to aid the sick leader of the foreign < br > soldier . he had play with their children , paid the shopkeep their < br > price without disput , and sat with the old men in the tea-hous . < br > nor had hi arm forc commit ani abus , although they held the < br > villag at their merci . it wa wisdom to tri to carri captain o ’ shea to < br > hi own peopl . the villag would gladli furnish a guid and plenti of < br > cooli , a cover litter , and a small house-boat in which the sick man < br > could be made comfort . < br > < br > the evacu of wang-li-fu wa a dismal busi . the adventur < br > were oppress by a sens of failur and discourag . their < br > enterpris had fizzl out like a dampen match . thi final act wa < br > inglori . their plight wa wors than when they had been strand as < br > beach-comb in shanghai . they carri captain o ’ shea to a sampan , < br > or flat-bottom boat , with a tini cabin of bamboo and mat , which < br > could be tow against the sluggish current of the river . the men < br > dispos themselv in the two boat save from the _whang ho_ steamer , < br > and a squad of half-nak cooli strung themselv along a towing-rop < br > to help track the sampan up-stream . < br > < br > the sick man lay stretch upon hi quilt and show littl interest < br > in the slow progress of the flotilla . between spell of heavi < br > drowsi he watch the slimi shore and fring marsh slide past . < br > through the first day the wind wa cool and the air bright , and the < br > boat trail up-riv until after nightfal befor they were pull < br > into the bank to moor . as the part of caution , no fire were made and < br > convers wa hush . the foreign had an uncomfort suspicion < br > that thi might be hostil territori , although they had discov < br > noth to warrant the conjectur . but o ’ shea had been babbl about < br > the paint joss while flighti with fever , and charley tong sin wa < br > still unaccount for . < br > < br > between midnight and morn the sick man came out of hi uneasi < br > dream . as it seem to him , he wa clear-head , hi sens alert , hi < br > judgment normal . just whi he should be coop up in thi nativ boat < br > wa a bit difficult to comprehend , but whi tri to understand it ? there < br > wa onli one problem of real import . and now wa the time to solv < br > it . o ’ shea laugh to think what a stupid , blunder fool he had been < br > to recruit an arm expedit and come clatter into thi corner of < br > china with so much fuss and nois . < br > < br > if a man want to find the paint joss , all he had to do wa listen < br > to the friendli , familiar voic that whisper in hi ear . o ’ shea < br > could hear them now . he accept them as a matter of cours . hi eye < br > were veri bright as he pull on hi shoe and fumbl for the revolv < br > in it holster under the pillow . curious enough , he wa no longer < br > consciou of great physic weak . it wa tremend urgent that < br > he should go to find the paint joss without a moment ’ s delay . hi men < br > would not understand if he should tell them about the friendli voic < br > that were offer to show him the way . they might tri to restrain him . < br > he must leav the boat quietli , unobserv . < br > < br > crawl from beneath the mat curtain , he gain the river bank . < br > hi knee were exceedingli shaki and hi hand trembl uncertainli , < br > but he wa confid that he had found the trail of the paint joss < br > and that hi vigor would soon return . charley tong sin outwit him ? < br > nonsens ! o ’ shea would have been startl beyond measur to know that < br > he wa wander off in delirium . he would have taken a shot at ani one < br > rash enough to tell him so . < br > < br > undetect he move along the shore , silent as a red indian , and wa < br > present lost in the dark . it wa muddi walk , and he turn < br > into the tall marsh grass , where a carpet of dead veget made < br > firmer foot . frequent he wa compel to halt and regain hi < br > labor breath , but hi purpos wa unwav . the voic drove him < br > on . he had no sens of fear . after some time hi errat progress led < br > him back to the river . there he stumbl over a log and sat down to < br > wait for daybreak , which had begun to flush the sky . < br > < br > hi head throb as though hammer were pound it and wave of < br > blur dizzi troubl him . what wa more disquiet , the guid < br > voic had ceas to talk to him . he felt crush disappoint and < br > sad . hi eye fill with tear . < br > < br > dawn found him seat dejectedli with hi back prop against the < br > log , hi head droop , while he stare at the muddi river . here he < br > would wait on the chanc that hi friend might find him . as the day < br > brighten , hi aimless vision wa caught by someth which power < br > awaken hi weari , befog percept . it act as a stimul of < br > tremend forc . sit bolt upright he gaze at a footprint , cleanli < br > outlin , which had becom sun-dri and harden in a stratum of clay . < br > < br > it had been made by a leather sole and heel . the outlin wa point < br > and narrow . into o ’ shea ’ s quicken memori there flash the pictur < br > of charley tong sin stretch upon the cabin floor of the _whang ho_ < br > steamer , hi patent-leath shoe wave gentli as he went to sleep < br > under the soporif influenc of a knock-out blow . he felt absolut < br > certain that thi particular print had been left by the fashion < br > footgear of the vanish comprador . the voic had guid him aright . < br > it wa here that charley tong sin had come ashor after make hi way < br > up the river of ten thousand evil smell in some kind of a nativ boat . < br > < br > there wa one chanc in a million that o ’ shea should have halt to < br > wait in thi precis spot where hi eye might see the thing . he < br > drag himself to hi feet and scan the melancholi landscap . < br > there were no villag in sight ; onli the marsh and field and a vast < br > mound of débri to mark the place where onc had stood a citi . even < br > the wall surround it had been level . it wa scarc more than < br > a wide-spread excresc of broken brick and tile partli overgrown < br > with veget . the landscap could have held no more desol < br > remind of the wreckag left in the wake of the tai ping rebel . < br > < br > it wa plausibl to surmis that thi wa the real wang-li-fu , the citi < br > which o ’ shea had set out to find . the squalid villag much lower down < br > the river might have been found by refuge who gave the same name to < br > their new abod . and the villag had been too ignor to explain the < br > blunder . to them there wa onli one wang-li-fu . how charley tong sin < br > must have laugh at leav o ’ shea and hi men to wast themselv in < br > a chase that led nowher . < br > < br > it wa a pallid , unshaven , totter ghost of captain michael o ’ shea < br > that muster strength to walk veri slowli in the direct of the < br > ruin citi . onc he paus and becam irresolut , but a littl way < br > beyond he found the imprint of a narrow shoe of european workmanship < br > on the soft bank of a ditch . hi stumbl step led him , as by an < br > uner divin , toward the highest part of the great mound of < br > débri where tall tree grew from the crumbl masonri . hi pain < br > advanc becam less difficult when he found a path from which the < br > obstruct had been remov . < br > < br > present he stood look across a clear space in the midst of < br > the ruin , invis from river or highway . in it were sever small < br > build and one much larger . the timber set into it wall were < br > carv and gild , the curv roof of dull red tile . there wa no < br > live thing in sight . thi isol commun wa so situat that it < br > wa wholli conceal from stranger , and the nativ of the region were < br > apt to shun the blast citi as haunt by demon . no watcher were < br > post to guard against intrus . < br > < br > o ’ shea cross the open space and made for the larg build , < br > which had the aspect of a templ . unhesitatingli he approach the < br > massiv wooden door and found them ajar . he walk like a man in a < br > tranc , mutter to himself . pass within , he enter a sort of < br > anteroom partit by mean of screen wonder embroid . < br > the stone pavement rang to the tread of hi heel . the place echo < br > with empti . he press on and came into a room of greater extent . < br > it corner were lost in shadow . row of pillar support the duski < br > rafter upon which gild dragon seem to writh . the window were < br > small and set close to the roof and the light of earli morn had not < br > dispel the gloom . < br > < br > in the centr of the floor wa an altar . behind it tower an imag of < br > buddha , and yet it wa unlik the imag of the bland and contempl < br > buddha commonli to be found in the templ of the east . it wa a < br > monstrou thing . onli an artist with an inspir from the devil < br > could have so handl tool as to make those wooden featur seem to < br > lust after all abomin wicked . the color of thi seat statu < br > wa crimson . amid the shadow it glow like fire or blood . on the < br > breast , abov the fold arm , stood out in broad , black stroke a < br > chines symbol or charact which o ’ shea recogn with a sensat of < br > creep repugn . < br > < br > “ the paint joss ! ” he gasp . < br > < br > hi attent wa so strongli caught and held by thi malevol imag < br > that for the moment he had eye for noth els . present , howev , < br > he becam awar that anoth figur confront him , a live presenc . < br > it wa a man sit in a massiv chair of teak-wood , by the side of < br > the buddha . the bulk of him wa enorm . he wa both fat and mighti < br > of frame , and not even the tower amplitud of the imag could dwarf < br > hi proport and belittl the impress he convey . hi face < br > wa broad and heavy-jowl , the mouth sensual and cruel . with fold < br > arm he sat and gaze at the foreign intrud . thi unflinch , < br > scorn immobl had a certain distinct . he believ that he must < br > instantli die at the hand of thi european with the white , savag face < br > and the blaze eye who cover him with a revolv . it wa futil to < br > cri out and summon help . as is customari with chines in posit of < br > author , thi high-priest of iniqu had gone to the templ to have < br > audienc with hi servitor veri earli in the morn . they had not yet < br > join him and o ’ shea wa quick to read hi own advantag . < br > < br > it wa right and just that he should slay thi huge man in the < br > crimson robe who rule the templ of the paint joss . he had come < br > ten thousand mile to be judg and execution . he wa readi to kill < br > and be kill in hi turn . but the revolv wa strang heavi and < br > it waver so that he wa unabl to hold it at arm ’ s length . a haze < br > bother hi vision and he could not brush it from hi eye . someth < br > wa the matter with hi knee . they were give way . with an incoher < br > exclam , o ’ shea fell unconsci upon the stone flag and < br > the revolv clatter from hi limp hand . he had paid the price of < br > exert beyond hi strength . < br > < br > when hi sens return there wa in hi mind onli the dimmest < br > recollect of how he came to be in thi dread place . the vagari < br > of fever no longer possess him . clear-head but wretchedli weak and < br > nerveless , he gaze about him and discov that he wa alon in the < br > unholi templ . the shadow were not so heavi on the pillar , the gild < br > rafter , and the marbl altar . the crimson imag of the seat buddha < br > loom flamboy and portent and the chines symbol paint on it < br > breast wa boldli outlin . < br > < br > there wa no way of escap . the build wa a most effectu prison . < br > hi revolv had been taken from him . he could not even fight and die < br > like a man . the fact wa that thi desper extrem lack the < br > proper sens of realiti . it wa so contrari to reason and he had such < br > shadowi , confus idea of what had preced , that thi wa more like < br > nightmar or delirium . and it seem imposs that he should not < br > present find himself awak . < br > < br > what most tenaci persist in hi memori wa the imag of the huge < br > man in the teak-wood chair . he wa a vision which could not be deni . < br > such a one as he had power to sway the will of other to hi desir , < br > to creat and direct great enterpris and send hi influenc afar , but < br > never for good . if he order murder done in distant place hi secret < br > edict would be obey , nor would hi agent dare to thwart him . if < br > there wa such an organ as o ’ shea had assum , then he had stood < br > face to face with the domin person , the compel forc from < br > which radiat infern activ . < br > < br > “ i saw him , whether i am meself or somebodi els , ” the prison < br > mutter with a groan . “ and he will come back and the brand will be < br > chop into me , same as wa done to poor bill maguir . ’ ti a tough < br > finish , if all thi is realli true . my god , i wish i knew what had < br > happen to me . yesterday i wa go up-riv with me men , and now -- -- ” < br > < br > he struggl to hi feet . a suprem effort of will conquer physic < br > weak . a man condemn to die is capabl of forget bodili ill . < br > just then a young man appear from the direct of the door-way . he < br > wore nativ garment , but o ’ shea recogn him . it wa charley tong < br > sin , whose smile wa unpleas . in hi hand wa o ’ shea ’ s revolv , < br > which he wa care to hold readi for use . the jaunti , affabl manner < br > of the comprador had return . he appear veri well satisfi with < br > himself as he exclaim , by way of greet . < br > < br > “ it is an unexpect pleasur , you bet , captain o ’ shea . i have wait < br > till you were gone from wang-li-fu . it wa report that you were veri < br > sick and went up the river yesterday with your men . you decid to come < br > and see us , to visit the paint joss ? you wish to make some troubl ? ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti the last day i will make troubl for ani one , by the look of < br > thing , ” repli o ’ shea . “ you win , charley. ” < br > < br > “ you are a smart man , ” grin the other . “ but you had too much < br > curios . i am a good fellow . i will tell you what you want to know . < br > you will not give it away . they are get readi to cut your visit < br > pretti short. ” < br > < br > there wa the chatter of voic somewher outsid and the brazen mutter < br > of a gong . o ’ shea kept silenc . he wa not as resign to hi fate as < br > charley tong sin infer . he wa watch everi motion of the gloat < br > young man and hi eye measur the distanc between them . < br > < br > “ you will feel better if you know , ” tauntingli cri the chines . “ you < br > have seen the paint joss . you have seen a man sit besid it , the < br > great and terribl chung himself , the ruler of the pih-lien-kiao , the < br > _sect of the fatal obligation_. ” < br > < br > “ much oblig , charley , ” grimli interrupt o ’ shea . “ tell me some more . < br > i am sorri i could not have word with the terribl chung . and the < br > brand that ye chop into peopl , your trademark ? ” < br > < br > “ it is the mark that mean _the dread messeng of chung_ . it is < br > a favor to tell you , captain o ’ shea . no other foreign , no chines < br > except the servant of chung , have heard it spoken . but you will not < br > speak it anywhere. ” < br > < br > “ there ’ s more that i want to know , ” said o ’ shea , “ though preciou < br > littl good the inform will do me. ” < br > < br > “ ha ! whi did you not have so much sens befor and mind your own < br > busi ? ” < br > < br > it wa absurd to carri on such a dialogu as thi , as o ’ shea perceiv , < br > but charley tong sin wa enjoy thi session with the rash shipmast < br > who had formerli held the upper hand . befor the victim could be < br > subject to further taunt he heard the massiv door open and < br > other sound to indic that bar were slide into place to fasten < br > them on the insid . the huge man in the crimson robe , the great and < br > terribl chung , lumber into view and seat himself in the chair of < br > teak-wood . charley tong sin humbl bow sever time . the personag < br > beckon the twain nearer and spoke briefli . he desir to conduct a < br > cross-examin of hi own with the comprador as interpret . < br > < br > “ he wish to know whi you have come to thi place ? ” wa the first < br > question address to o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ becaus ye butcher a friend of mine , a red-head sailor by the name < br > of jim eldridg , ” wa the unflinch repli . “ he told me about your < br > dirti devil as well as he could , and i saw what ye did to him. ” < br > < br > the huge man show sign of constern when thi wa convey to < br > him . he utter a bellow interrog . < br > < br > “ he is not aliv ? you have talk with hi ghost ? ” shrilli demand < br > charley tong sin . < br > < br > “ ’ twa him that sent me here , ” declar o ’ shea . “ ye can impart it to < br > the big ugli mug yonder that i have had visit from the ghost of the < br > red-head sailor that he kill and branded. ” < br > < br > with an excit , heedless gestur , charley tong sin rais the < br > revolv . he had been long accustom to wear european cloth , and < br > the flow sleev of hi chines outer garment imped hi motion . a < br > fold of the silk fabric fell over the butt of the weapon , and he tri < br > to brush it asid with hi left hand . thi other sleev wa caught and < br > held for a moment by the sharp firing-pin of the cock hammer . < br > < br > thi trifl mishap , gave o ’ shea a desper opportun . with a flash < br > of hi normal agil he leap across the interven space . the < br > comprador strove frantic to free the weapon , but onli entangl it < br > the more . the episod wa close befor the crimson-rob personag < br > could play a part . o ’ shea ’ s shoulder ram charley tong sin and sent < br > him sprawl , and the revolv wa instantli wrest from hi grasp . < br > < br > “ the door are lock , ” pant o ’ shea , “ and befor your men break in , i < br > will send the both of ye to hell . sit where you are , ye terribl chung . < br > you overplay your game , charley. ” < br > < br > the comprador seem to shrink within hi cloth . hi mouth hung open < br > and hi face wa ashen . he wa eager to clutch at ani straw which might < br > give him the chanc of life . shrink from the scowl presenc in < br > the chair , he began to talk a sing-song babbl of word that tumbl < br > over each other . < br > < br > “ i will help you get away aliv if you do not kill me . captain o ’ shea , < br > i will explain about jim eldridg ; i will not lie to you . all the < br > secret i will tell you . there wa a steamer , the _tai yan_ , and she < br > came over the bar from the sea in a big storm , at the time of a flood . < br > it wa do thi or go to the bottom becaus the engin had broke . < br > a boat with sailor row up the river . they were foolish men who < br > believ the stori that gold and silver treasur wa hidden in the < br > ruin of thi old wang-li-fu . and they found thi templ , and they knew < br > too much . < br > < br > “ all but two of the men were abl to run quick to the river , but < br > eldridg and one name mcdougal ran into thi place , tri to hide . < br > they ran into the templ befor they were captur . there wa a < br > littl build , but now it is ash and much stick of burnt wood . < br > in that build those two men were lock to be kill next day . the < br > red-head man wa a demon , i tell you . wall could not hold him . in < br > the night he set fire to the build , and it wa a great blaze . but he < br > wa caught and punished. ” < br > < br > “ ye left him for dead , and he came to , ” growl o ’ shea . “ and so < br > mcdougal got away ! ” < br > < br > “ i can tell you more secret , ” wail charley tong sin , but hi < br > servic as an inform were suddenli cut short . the huge man in < br > the chair had rais hi voic in a tremend call for help to hi < br > follow without . otherwis he had sat compos , glare at o ’ shea . < br > it wa hi hand that slew charley tong sin as a traitor . he wa on hi < br > feet , the heavi chair rais aloft . he swung it with amaz eas . it < br > wa no longer a massiv articl of furnitur , but a missil in the < br > hand of a man of gigant strength . hi movement were not clumsi . < br > < br > the chair flew through the air . o ’ shea dodg , but charley tong sin < br > flung up hi arm , taken unawar . the impact would have brain an ox . < br > the whirl mass of teak smote the terrifi comprador on the head < br > and chest and he crumpl to the pavement . he wa as dead as though he < br > had been caught beneath the hammer of a pile-driv . the tableau wa < br > an extraordinari one . o ’ shea stood stare at the broken bodi of the < br > young chines . the man in the crimson robe stir not from hi track . < br > implac , unafraid , he had execut the last sentenc of _the sect of < br > the fatal obligation_ . < br > < br > the peopl outsid were clamor at the door , and o ’ shea heard the < br > thud and crash of some kind of an improvis battering-ram . he sigh < br > and found the thought of death at their hand veri bitter . but he would < br > not go alon . he face the great and terribl chung and slowli rais < br > the revolv . < br > < br > the arch-assassin bade him wait with a gestur so imperi , so < br > mandatori , that o ’ shea hesit . the bear of the man held some < br > larg signific . hi dark , evil counten express rather sad < br > than wrath . he slid a hand into the fold of hi robe and rais the < br > hand to hi mouth . whatev it wa that he swallow wrought it work < br > with swift and deadli virul . sway like a tree about to fall , he < br > strode to the marbl altar and fell across it with hi head buri in < br > hi arm . in thi postur he die , in front of the imag of the glow < br > buddha , whose graven lineament seem to express the unholi ambit < br > and emot of hi own soul . < br > < br > o ’ shea manag to walk to a corner of the templ and slump down upon < br > a marbl bench where the paint joss cast it deepest shadow . hi < br > strength had eb again . listlessli , almost inattent , he heard the < br > assault upon the door renew and the splinter of plank . when the < br > chines mob came tumbl in he could tri to shoot straight and hit a < br > few of them , and then they would close in on him . it wa the end of the < br > game . < br > < br > a few minut and the servitor of chung came jostl and shout < br > through the anteroom . then they halt abruptli . their nois wa < br > hush . the light that fell from the window near the roof show them < br > the lifeless figur in the crimson robe , doubl across the marbl < br > altar . in the foreground lay the batter bodi of charley tong sin , but < br > they had eye onli for the tragedi of the altar . they stood dumfound , < br > like men in the presenc of someth incred . < br > < br > at length the boldest shuffl forward . the other follow timidli . < br > they appear terrifi in the extrem . it wa as though they had < br > believ their master to be invulner . and he wa dead . possibl < br > they conjectur that he had been slain by an agenc more than mortal . < br > the group of chines cluster about the altar , whisper , regard < br > the bodi of chung . appar they had not bethought themselv of the < br > foreign who wa held a prison in the templ . < br > < br > o ’ shea rose in hi shadowi corner and move wearili past the paint < br > joss . it wa better to have the thing finish . he came upon the < br > chines like an apparit . their wit were so fuddl that the sight < br > of him had the effect of anoth shock . if he had been power enough < br > to slay the mighti chung , then the demon were hi alli . perceiv < br > their daze condit , he forebor to shoot , and advanc abreast of < br > the altar . the path to the door-way wa clear , but he had not the < br > strength to make a run for it . the hope of life , miracul restor < br > to him , wa in the possibl that they might stand and gaze at him a < br > littl longer . < br > < br > he had walk a half-dozen step farther when one of the crowd yell . < br > the spell wa broken . they race after him like wolv . he turn and < br > steadi himself and pull trigger until the revolv wa empti . < br > the onset wa check and thrown into bloodi confus . o ’ shea had < br > summarili convinc them that whether or not the demon were in leagu < br > with him , the devil wa in thi readi weapon of hi . < br > < br > they were no longer mass between him and the exit , and for the moment < br > the advantag undeni belong to thi mysteri , devast < br > foreign . < br > < br > he stumbl over the broken timber of the door and wa in the bless < br > daylight , the templ behind him . he would be overtaken ere he could < br > flee the ruin citi , but he reload the revolv as he follow the < br > path at a stagger trot . the mob pour out of the templ , yelp < br > in high-key choru . as a foot-rac the hapless captain michael < br > o ’ shea wa in excess poor condit . in fact , it promis to be < br > the easiest kind of a matter to overtak him and leisur pelt him to < br > death with brick as soon as he should have expend hi ammunit . < br > < br > he swerv from the rough path and crawl to the top of a low ridg < br > of débri . stand erect for a moment , he pitch forward and fell < br > against a bit of wall . hi figur had been outlin against the sky , < br > and it wa discern in a fleet glimps by a scatter band of men < br > in khaki and linen cloth who were tramp the marsh . they rais a < br > shout and rush toward the ruin citi , converg until the forc wa < br > mobil within a short distanc of the prostrat o ’ shea . < br > < br > the chines mob , pursu full-tilt , found itself confront a score < br > and more of rifl which enthusiast open fire until the air < br > hum with bullet . there wa a hasti , unanim retreat of the < br > follow of chung to the templ and the adjac build . major < br > bannist halt to bend over o ’ shea and say : < br > < br > “ we thought you were drown or bog in the marsh . what sort of a < br > rumpu is thi ? ” < br > < br > “ the paint joss , ” murmur o ’ shea . “ i found it . don ’ t bother with me . < br > go to it and clean out the place. ” < br > < br > the adventur , at last earn their wage , proceed to make < br > thing most unpleas for the household of chung . the resist wa < br > brief , and those who were not pen within the templ fled in panic < br > and sought cover in the marsh . they were taken by surpris , for the < br > commun had found the visit of captain o ’ shea suffici to engag < br > it attent . to him return major bannist , hot and dusti , hi < br > cheek bleed from the cut of a chines sword , and smilingli announc : < br > < br > “ bulli good fun while it last . what shall i do with the devil we < br > corner ? take them out and shoot them ? ” < br > < br > “ no . the boss of the work is dead . and i have a notion that _the sect < br > of the fatal obligation_ die with him . lug me to the templ , if ye < br > pleas . i ’ m all in , but ’ ti my wish to see the whole wick busi < br > go up in smoke. ” < br > < br > befor the torch wa appli , that experienc man of war , major < br > bannist , suggest that he had never seen a more promis place in < br > which to poke about for loot . the search amount to noth until it < br > occur to the major to pull the paint joss from off it pedest . < br > after much heav and pri the great imag fell crash to the < br > pavement of the templ . investig reveal that underneath it were < br > sever compart access by mean of cunningli fit panel . < br > mani paper or document were found , wrap in silk , and it wa < br > assum that these were the record of the black deed of chung and hi < br > organ murder . they were thrown asid , to be bundl togeth and < br > taken to the boat . < br > < br > it wa the astut major bannist who smash the bottom of one of < br > these compart with a rifle-butt and ram hi hand through the < br > splinter hole . hi grope finger came in contact with close < br > pack row of metal bar . in thi manner wa discov the wealth of < br > the templ , the blood-money store and treasur by the infam chung , < br > the price of mani assassin . < br > < br > the gold wa in stamp ingot , the silver in the lump or “ shoe ” < br > of the clumsi chines currenc , and there were basket of english < br > sovereign , mexican dollar , and a varieti of the coinag which pass < br > over the counter of the money-chang of the orient . murder as a < br > busi had paid well . _the sect of the fatal obligation_ wa a < br > flourish concern . the loot belong to those who found it . they were < br > troubl by no scrupl respect the heir of the depart chung , nor < br > did they consid it their duti to surrend the spoil to the chines < br > govern . < br > < br > that night a conflagr redden the ruin of the dead citi of < br > wang-li-fu . it wa the pyre of the paint joss . and when the littl < br > flotilla again move up-riv earli next morn , a cloud of smoke rose < br > lazili in the still air . captain michael o ’ shea wa still aliv , which < br > wa rather surpris , for he had pass through experi extrem < br > disturb to a sick man . there wa tonic , howev , in the fact that he < br > had redeem hi failur , the expedit wa no longer a sorri jest , < br > and the account of bill maguir had been squar . < br > < br > he slept with tremend earnest through a night and a day , and < br > when he awok it wa to roar for food and to display the peevish temper < br > of a genuin convalesc . when off duti hi comrad becam absorb < br > in the odd occup of arrang pile of gold bar , silver “ shoe , ” < br > and mint coin on the deck of the littl house-boat , like children < br > play with block . they smile a great deal and talk to themselv . < br > captain o ’ shea look on with an air of fatherli interest . after all , < br > thi happi famili of hi had made a prosper voyag of it . dream < br > of rehabilit cheer these broken wander . they would go home . < br > no more for them the miseri , the heartach , the humili of the < br > tropic tramp . their rich might slip through their finger , but they < br > would make the most of golden opportun . like poor mcdougal , they had < br > thrown all regret away . < br > < br > “ ’ ti share and share alik , ” said o ’ shea , “ but there is a red-head < br > sailor-man at anchor on a farm in main and i think he ha a wife < br > somewher . with your permiss we will deal him a share of the < br > plunder . ’ twa poor bill maguir that gave us the tip. ” < br > < br > unmind of labor and hardship , thi content compani slowli < br > journey to the head of navig on the river of ten thousand evil < br > smell and then trudg overland while o ’ shea rode in a cover chair < br > and sang old sea-chanti in a mellow voic . when , at length , the < br > english mission station wa reach it wa stretch the truth to call < br > him an invalid . the senior missionari , a gentl , veri wise old man who < br > had live for thirti year in the back countri , heard the tale told < br > by these tan , rag travel and wa horrifi that such thing < br > should have exist . but he had news for them , and it wa thu that he < br > suppli a miss fragment of the puzzl of bill maguir : < br > < br > “ the man came here and we took care of him . but there wa no find < br > out how he had been so fright hurt . he wa dumb and stupid . < br > later i met a nativ boatman who had found him on the river-bank near < br > wang-li-fu . evid he had been thrown into the water as an easi way < br > to get rid of the bodi . reviv a littl , he splash hi way ashor < br > or the tide left him there . he stay with us until he wa fairli < br > strong and one morn he wa gone. ” < br > < br > “ and did he set the hous afir ? ” inquir o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ whi , there were two accident fire in the compound at that time , < br > but we laid it to the careless of the kitchen cooli , ” wa the < br > innoc repli . < br > < br > “ it wa bill maguir , all right , ” declar o ’ shea . “ now , will ye be < br > good enough to look over the chines document we found hid away under < br > the paint joss ? ” < br > < br > the missionari pore over the paper for sever hour . and hi < br > painstak translat reveal all that o ’ shea care to know < br > concern the oper of _the sect of the fatal obligation_ . it had < br > work in secret to remov enemi for a price . if a merchant wish < br > a busi rival obliter , if an offici found other in hi way , < br > if it wa advantag to creat a vacanc in some other quarter , the < br > murder guild direct by the depart chung would transact the affair , < br > smoothli , without bungl . and those who knew and would have disclos < br > the secret were frighten into silenc by the sight of the brand that < br > wa call _the dread messeng of chung_ . < br > < br > “ it will interest you to learn , as an american , captain o ’ shea , ” said < br > the missionari , “ that among these document is a list of person < br > proscrib or sentenc to be slain . the most conspicu name i < br > find to be that of the chines ambassador to the unit state , hi < br > excel hao su ting . it is probabl that thi terribl fate would < br > have await him upon hi return to hi own country. ” < br > < br > “ they pot hi brother , ” exclaim o ’ shea . “ and he wa sick with fear < br > of the thing , for i talk it over with him meself . well , he can thank < br > bill maguir for let him die in hi bed when hi proper time comes. ” < br > < br > three week later captain o ’ shea sat at hi eas upon the piazza of the < br > grand hotel , that overlook yokohama bay . he wa thinner than when he < br > had put to sea in the _whang ho_ steamer , but he appear to find the < br > game of life quit worth while . it wa hi pleasur to enjoy the tame < br > divers of a tourist befor board a mail-boat for the long run < br > home to san francisco . he smile as he reread a letter written in the < br > crab fist of that zealou agriculturist , johnni kent , who had thi < br > to say : < br > < br > dear captain mike : < br > < br > the lord onli know what troubl you ’ ll be in when thi get to < br > china . my advic is to quit it and come home . i ’ m worri about < br > you . bill maguir ha round to , understand ? hi bust main hatch < br > sort of mend itself by degre . he had symptom befor you left , < br > and you ought to have wait , but i suppos you can ’ t help be < br > young and irish . < br > < br > he wa terribl melancholi at first , and he ain ’ t real spri yet . i < br > found hi wife and littl girl for him in baltimor , and made them < br > come on here . you guess right about the wax doll . i bought the < br > darndest , biggest one i could find . bill feel that the famili is < br > live on my chariti , and be morbid and down-heart , he fret a < br > whole lot about be broke and strand . he ’ ll be no good to go to < br > sea again . it give him the shiver to talk about it . i don ’ t need < br > him as a farm-hand in the winter , and as for have hi wife as a < br > steadi house-keep , i ’ m fussi and set in my way . < br > < br > bill got up against an aw bad combin in china . i won ’ t tell < br > you where it wa , for i don ’ t want you to find it . mayb you ’ ll run < br > across a man name mcdougal out there . he wa with bill when they < br > got in troubl . bill saw a chanc to get away in the night , but he < br > stood the crowd off somehow to give mcdougal leeway to join him . < br > and thi mcdougal lit out with never a thought for bill . there wa < br > someth wrong with mcdougal , as i figur it out . mayb he wa a < br > good man , but here wa one time when he fell down on hi job . none < br > of us say much about it , captain mike , but we all pray we won ’ t get < br > caught that way . you know what i mean . we ’ re afraid there may be a < br > weak spot in us that we don ’ t know is there until we have to face < br > the music . anyhow , as i gather from bill , mcdougal wa a quitter . < br > if i know anyth about men , he ha wish a hundr time sinc < br > that he had stay to take hi medicin with bill . we would a heap < br > sight rather see you come home aliv than to go monkey with < br > the paint joss . noth much ha happen except a dri spell in < br > august and corn and potato set back . hen are lay well . < br > < br > your friend , < br > j. kent . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea chuckl and then becam thought . paddi blake and < br > mcdougal . charley tong sin and the wreck of the _whang ho_ . wang-li-fu < br > and the terribl chung . much can happen within the space of a few week < br > to a man that will seek the long trail . present he took from hi < br > leather bill-book sever slip of paper which he had receiv from the < br > yokohama speci bank in exchang for hi gold bar and silver “ shoes. ” < br > after make sundri calcul with a pencil , he said to himself : < br > < br > “ the share of jim eldridg , alia bill maguir , is nine thousand < br > eight hundr and sixty-two dollar and eleven cent , and ’ ti here < br > all ship-shap in two draft on new york . my piec of the loot is the < br > same . but the red-head sailorman will never be the lad he wa , and he < br > should not be worri by the lack of money to live on . and could ani < br > money pay for what he went through ? ’ ti easi to know what i should do . < br > i will not take a cent of the plunder . my share i will give to bill , < br > and with hi bit of it he will be comfort fixed. ” < br > < br > an express of boyish satisfact brighten hi resolut featur < br > as he ad : < br > < br > “ a man would be asham to take money for such a pleasant vacat as < br > thi one ha been . now , i will send a cabl messag to bill maguir and < br > it will cheer him a lot . hi account is squar . and i think i have put < br > a crimp in _the sect of the fatal
