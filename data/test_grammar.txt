 hadst thou but lov 'd him half so well as i , 
 or felt that pain which i did for him onc , 
 or nourish 'd him as i did with my blood , 
 thou wouldst have left thi dearest heart-blood there 
 rather than have made that savag duke thine heir , 
 and disinherit thine onli son .

 as thou shalt reign but by their suffer . 
 to entail him and hi heir unto the crown , 
 what is it but to make thi sepulchr 
 and creep into it far befor thi time ? 
 warwick is chancellor and the lord of calai ; 
 stern falconbridg command the narrow sea ; 
 the duke is made protector of the realm ; 
 and yet shalt thou be safe ? such safeti find 
 the trembl lamb environ with wolv . 
 had i been there , which am a silli woman ,

 king henri . gentl son edward , thou wilt stay with me ? 
 queen margaret . ay , to be murder 'd by hi enemi . 
 princ of wale . when i return with victori from the field 
 i 'll see your grace ; till then i 'll follow her . 
 queen margaret . come , son , away ; we may not linger thu . 
 exeunt queen margaret and the princ 
 king henri . poor queen ! how love to me and to her son 
 hath made her break out into term of rage ! 
 reveng 'd may she be on that hate duke ,

 tire on the flesh of me and of my son !

 richard . an oath is of no moment , be not took 
 befor a true and law magistr 
 that hath author over him that swear . 
 henri had none , but did usurp the place ;

 your oath , my lord , is vain and frivol . 
 therefor , to arm . and , father , do but think

 within whose circuit is elysium 
 and all that poet feign of bliss and joy . 
 whi do we linger thu ? i can not rest

 whom we have left protector of the king , 
 with pow'r polici strengthen themselv

 and so he come , to rend hi limb asund . 
 ah , gentl clifford , kill me with thi sword , 
 and not with such a cruel threat'n look ! 
 sweet clifford , hear me speak befor i die . 
 i am too mean a subject for thi wrath ; 
 be thou reveng 'd on men , and let me live . 
 clifford . in vain thou speak'st , poor boy ; my father 's blood 
 hath stopp 'd the passag where thi word should enter . 
 rutland . then let my father 's blood open it again : 
 he is a man , and , clifford , cope with him . 
 clifford . had i thi brethren here , their live and thine 
 were not reveng suffici for me ; 
 no , if i digg 'd up thi forefath ' grave 
 and hung their rotten coffin up in chain , 
 it could not slake mine ire nor eas my heart . 
 the sight of ani of the hous of york 
 is as a furi to torment my soul ; 
 and till i root out their accurs line 
 and leav not one aliv , i live in hell . 
 therefore- 
 rutland . o , let me pray befor i take my death ! 
 to thee i pray : sweet clifford , piti me .

 ah , let me live in prison all my day ; 
 and when i give occas of offenc 
 then let me die , for now thou hast no caus . 
 clifford . no caus ! 
 thi father slew my father ; therefor , die . [ stab him ] 
 rutland . di faciant laudi summa sit ista tuae ! [ die ] 
 clifford . plantagenet , i come , plantagenet ;

 my uncl both are slain in rescu me ; 
 and all my follow to the eager foe

 or lamb pursu 'd by hunger-starv wolv . 
 my sons- god know what hath bechanc them ; 
 but thi i know- they have demean 'd themselv 
 like men born to renown by life or death . 
 three time did richard make a lane to me , 
 and thrice cri 'courag , father ! fight it out . ' 
 and full as oft came edward to my side 
 with purpl falchion , paint to the hilt 
 in blood of those that had encount'r him . 
 and when the hardiest warrior did retir , 
 richard cri 'charg , and give no foot of ground ! ' 
 and cri ' a crown , or els a gloriou tomb ! 
 a sceptr , or an earthli sepulchr ! ' 
 with thi we charg 'd again ; but out ala ! 
 we bodg 'd again ; as i have seen a swan 
 with bootless labour swim against the tide 
 and spend her strength with over-match wave . 
 [ a short alarum within ] 
 ah , hark ! the fatal follow do pursu , 
 and i am faint and can not fli their furi ; 
 and were i strong , i would not shun their furi . 
 the sand are numb'r that make up my life ; 
 here must i stay , and here my life must end . 
 
 enter queen margaret , clifford , northumberland , 
 the princ of wale , and soldier 
 
 come , bloodi clifford , rough northumberland , 
 i dare your quenchless furi to more rage ; 
 i am your butt , and i abid your shot . 
 northumberland . yield to our merci , proud plantagenet . 
 clifford . ay , to such merci as hi ruthless arm 
 with downright payment show 'd unto my father . 
 now phaethon hath tumbl from hi car , 
 and made an even at the noontid prick . 
 york . my ash , as the phoenix , may bring forth 
 a bird that will reveng upon you all ; 
 and in that hope i throw mine eye to heaven , 
 scorn whate' you can afflict me with . 
 whi come you not ? what ! multitud , and fear ? 
 clifford . so coward fight when they can fli no further ; 
 so dove do peck the falcon 's pierc talon ; 
 so desper thiev , all hopeless of their live , 
 breath out invect 'gainst the offic . 
 york . o clifford , but bethink thee onc again , 
 and in thi thought o'errun my former time ; 
 and , if thou canst for blush , view thi face , 
 and bite thi tongu that slander him with cowardic 
 whose frown hath made thee faint and fli ere thi ! 
 clifford . i will not bandi with thee word for word , 
 but buckler with thee blow , twice two for one . 
 queen margaret . hold , valiant clifford ; for a thousand caus 
 i would prolong awhil the traitor 's life . 
 wrath make him deaf ; speak thou , northumberland . 
 northumberland . hold , clifford ! do not honour him so much 
 to prick thi finger , though to wound hi heart . 
 what valour were it , when a cur doth grin , 
 for one to thrust hi hand between hi teeth , 
 when he might spurn him with hi foot away ? 
 it is war 's prize to take all vantag ; 
 and ten to one is no impeach of valour . 
 [ they lay hand on york , who struggl ] 
 clifford . ay , ay , so strive the woodcock with the gin . 
 northumberland . so doth the coni struggl in the net . 
 york . so triumph thiev upon their conquer 'd booti ; 
 so true men yield , with robber so o'er-match 'd . 
 northumberland . what would your grace have done unto him now ? 
 queen margaret . brave warrior , clifford and northumberland , 
 come , make him stand upon thi molehil here 
 that raught at mountain with outstretch arm , 
 yet part but the shadow with hi hand . 
 what , wa it you that would be england 's king ? 
 was't you that revel 'd in our parliament 
 and made a preachment of your high descent ? 
 where are your mess of son to back you now ? 
 the wanton edward and the lusti georg ? 
 and where 's that valiant crook-back prodigi , 
 dicki your boy , that with hi grumbl voic 
 wa wont to cheer hi dad in mutini ? 
 or , with the rest , where is your darl rutland ? 
 look , york : i stain 'd thi napkin with the blood 
 that valiant clifford with hi rapier 's point 
 made issu from the bosom of the boy ; 
 and if thine eye can water for hi death , 
 i give thee thi to dri thi cheek withal . 
 ala , poor york ! but that i hate thee deadli , 
 i should lament thi miser state . 
 i prithe griev to make me merri , york . 
 what , hath thi fieri heart so parch 'd thine entrail 
 that not a tear can fall for rutland 's death ? 
 whi art thou patient , man ? thou shouldst be mad ; 
 and i to make thee mad do mock thee thu . 
 stamp , rave , and fret , that i may sing and danc . 
 thou wouldst be fee 'd , i see , to make me sport ; 
 york can not speak unless he wear a crown . 
 a crown for york ! -and , lord , bow low to him . 
 hold you hi hand whilst i do set it on . 
 [ put a paper crown on hi head ] 
 ay , marri , sir , now look he like a king ! 
 ay , thi is he that took king henri 's chair , 
 and thi is he wa hi adopt heir . 
 but how is it that great plantagenet 
 is crown 'd so soon and broke hi solemn oath ? 
 as i bethink me , you should not be king 
 till our king henri had shook hand with death . 
 and will you pale your head in henri 's glori , 
 and rob hi templ of the diadem , 
 now in hi life , against your holi oath ? 
 o , 't is a fault too too 
 off with the crown and with the crown hi head ; 
 and , whilst we breath , take time to do him dead . 
 clifford . that is my offic , for my father 's sake . 
 queen margaret . nay , stay ; let 's hear the orison he make . 
 york . she-wolf of franc , but wors than wolv of franc , 
 whose tongu more poison than the adder 's tooth ! 
 how ill-beseem is it in thi sex 
 to triumph like an amazonian trull 
 upon their woe whom fortun captiv ! 
 but that thi face is visard-lik , unchang , 
 made impud with use of evil deed , 
 i would assay , proud queen , to make thee blush . 
 to tell thee whenc thou cam'st , of whom deriv 'd , 
 were shame enough to shame thee , wert thou not shameless . 
 thi father bear the type of king of napl , 
 of both the sicil and jerusalem , 
 yet not so wealthi as an english yeoman . 
 hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult ? 
 it need not , nor it boot thee not , proud queen ; 
 unless the adag must be verifi , 
 that beggar mount run their hors to death . 
 't is beauti that doth oft make women proud ; 
 but , god he know , thi share thereof is small . 
 't is virtu that doth make them most admir 'd ; 
 the contrari doth make thee wond'r at . 
 't is govern that make them seem divin ; 
 the want thereof make thee abomin . 
 thou art as opposit to everi good 
 as the antipod are unto us , 
 or as the south to the septentrion . 
 o tiger 's heart wrapp 'd in a woman 's hide ! 
 how couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child , 
 to bid the father wipe hi eye withal , 
 and yet be seen to bear a woman 's face ? 
 women are soft , mild , piti , and flexibl : 
 thou stern , obdur , flinti , rough , remorseless . 
 bid'st thou me rage ? whi , now thou hast thi wish ; 
 wouldst have me weep ? whi , now thou hast thi will ; 
 for rage wind blow up incess shower , 
 and when the rage allay , the rain begin . 
 these tear are my sweet rutland 's obsequi ; 
 and everi drop cri vengeanc for hi death 
 'gainst thee , fell clifford , and thee , fals frenchwoman . 
 northumberland . beshrew me , but hi passion move me so 
 that hardli can i check my eye from tear . 
 york . that face of hi the hungri cannib 
 would not have touch 'd , would not have stain 'd with blood ; 
 but you are more inhuman , more inexorable- 
 o , ten time more- than tiger of hyrcania . 
 see , ruthless queen , a hapless father 's tear . 
 thi cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy , 
 and i with tear do wash the blood away . 
 keep thou the napkin , and go boast of thi ; 
 and if thou tell'st the heavi stori right , 
 upon my soul , the hearer will shed tear ; 
 yea , even my foe will shed fast-fal tear 
 and say 'ala , it wa a piteou deed ! ' 
 there , take the crown , and with the crown my curs ; 
 and in thi need such comfort come to thee 
 as now i reap at thi too cruel hand ! 
 hard-heart clifford , take me from the world ; 
 my soul to heaven , my blood upon your head ! 
 northumberland . had he been slaughter-man to all my kin , 
 i should not for my life but weep with him , 
 to see how inli sorrow gripe hi soul . 
 queen margaret . what , weeping-rip , my lord northumberland ? 
 think but upon the wrong he did us all , 
 and that will quickli dri thi melt tear . 
 clifford . here 's for my oath , here 's for my father 's death . 
 [ stab him ] 
 queen margaret . and here 's to right our gentle-heart king . 
 [ stab him ] 
 york . open thi gate of merci , graciou god ! 
 my soul fli through these wound to seek out thee . 
 [ die ] 
 queen margaret . off with hi head , and set it on york gate ; 
 so york may overlook the town of york .

 act ii . scene i . 
 a plain near mortim 's cross in herefordshir 
 
 a march . enter edward , richard , and their power 
 
 edward . i wonder how our princ father scap 'd , 
 or whether he be scap 'd away or no 
 from clifford 's and northumberland 's pursuit . 
 had he been ta'en , we should have heard the news ; 
 had he been slain , we should have heard the news ; 
 or had he scap 'd , methink we should have heard 
 the happi tide of hi good escap . 
 how fare my brother ? whi is he so sad ? 
 richard . i can not joy until i be resolv 'd 
 where our right valiant father is becom . 
 i saw him in the battl rang about , 
 and watch 'd him how he singl clifford forth . 
 methought he bore him in the thickest troop 
 as doth a lion in a herd of neat ; 
 or as a bear , encompass 'd round with dog , 
 who have pinch 'd a few and made them cri , 
 the rest stand all aloof and bark at him . 
 so far 'd our father with hi enemi ; 
 so fled hi enemi my warlik father . 
 methink 't is prize enough to be hi son . 
 see how the morn ope her golden gate 
 and take her farewel of the gloriou sun . 
 how well resembl it the prime of youth , 
 trimm 'd like a younker pranc to hi love ! 
 edward . dazzl mine eye , or do i see three sun ? 
 richard . three gloriou sun , each one a perfect sun ; 
 not separ with the rack cloud , 
 but sever 'd in a pale clear-shin sky . 
 see , see ! they join , embrac , and seem to kiss , 
 as if they vow 'd some leagu inviol . 
 now are they but one lamp , one light , one sun . 
 in thi the heaven figur some event . 
 edward . 't is wondrou strang , the like yet never heard of . 
 i think it cite us , brother , to the field , 
 that we , the son of brave plantagenet , 
 each one alreadi blaze by our meed , 
 should notwithstand join our light togeth 
 and overshin the earth , as thi the world . 
 whate' it bode , henceforward will i bear 
 upon my target three fair shine sun . 
 richard . nay , bear three daughters- by your leav i speak it , 
 you love the breeder better than the male . 
 
 enter a messeng , blow 
 
 but what art thou , whose heavi look foretel 
 some dread stori hang on thi tongu ? 
 messeng . ah , one that wa a woeful looker-on 
 when as the nobl duke of york wa slain , 
 your princ father and my love lord ! 
 edward . o , speak no more ! for i have heard too much . 
 richard . say how he die , for i will hear it all . 
 messeng . environ he wa with mani foe , 
 and stood against them as the hope of troy 
 against the greek that would have ent'r troy . 
 but hercul himself must yield to odd ; 
 and mani stroke , though with a littl axe , 
 hew down and fell the hardest-timb 'd oak . 
 by mani hand your father wa subdu 'd ; 
 but onli slaught'r by the ire arm 
 of unrel clifford and the queen , 
 who crown 'd the graciou duke in high despit , 
 laugh 'd in hi face ; and when with grief he wept , 
 the ruthless queen gave him to dri hi cheek 
 a napkin steep in the harmless blood 
 of sweet young rutland , by rough clifford slain ; 
 and after mani scorn , mani foul taunt , 
 they took hi head , and on the gate of york 
 they set the same ; and there it doth remain , 
 the saddest spectacl that e'er i view 'd . 
 edward . sweet duke of york , our prop to lean upon , 
 now thou art gone , we have no staff , no stay . 
 o clifford , boist'rou clifford , thou hast slain 
 the flow ' r of europ for hi chivalri ; 
 and treacher hast thou vanquish 'd him , 
 for hand to hand he would have vanquish 'd thee . 
 now my soul 's palac is becom a prison . 
 ah , would she break from henc , that thi my bodi 
 might in the ground be close up in rest ! 
 for never henceforth shall i joy again ; 
 never , o never , shall i see more joy . 
 richard . i can not weep , for all my bodi 's moistur 
 scarc serv to quench my furnace-burn heart ; 
 nor can my tongu unload my heart 's great burden , 
 for self-sam wind that i should speak withal 
 is kindl coal that fire all my breast , 
 and burn me up with flame that tear would quench . 
 to weep is to make less the depth of grief . 
 tear then for babe ; blow and reveng for me ! 
 richard , i bear thi name ; i 'll veng thi death , 
 or die renown by attempt it . 
 edward . hi name that valiant duke hath left with thee ; 
 hi dukedom and hi chair with me is left . 
 richard . nay , if thou be that princ eagl 's bird , 
 show thi descent by gaze 'gainst the sun ; 
 for chair and dukedom , throne and kingdom , say : 
 either that is thine , or els thou wert not hi . 
 
 march . enter warwick , montagu , and their armi 
 
 warwick . how now , fair lord ! what fare ? what news abroad ? 
 richard . great lord of warwick , if we should recount 
 our bale news and at each word 's deliver 
 stab poinard in our flesh till all were told , 
 the word would add more anguish than the wound . 
 o valiant lord , the duke of york is slain ! 
 edward . o warwick , warwick ! that plantagenet 
 which held thee dearli as hi soul 's redempt 
 is by the stern lord clifford done to death . 
 warwick . ten day ago i drown 'd these news in tear ; 
 and now , to add more measur to your woe , 
 i come to tell you thing sith then befall'n . 
 after the bloodi fray at wakefield fought , 
 where your brave father breath 'd hi latest gasp , 
 tide , as swiftli as the post could run , 
 were brought me of your loss and hi depart . 
 i , then in london , keeper of the king , 
 muster 'd my soldier , gather flock of friend , 
 and veri well appoint , as i thought , 
 march 'd toward saint alban to intercept the queen , 
 bear the king in my behalf along ; 
 for by my scout i wa advertis 
 that she wa come with a full intent 
 to dash our late decre in parliament 
 touch king henri 's oath and your success . 
 short tale to make- we at saint alban met , 
 our battl join 'd , and both side fierc fought ; 
 but whether 't wa the cold of the king , 
 who look 'd full gentli on hi warlik queen , 
 that robb 'd my soldier of their heat spleen , 
 or whether 't wa report of her success , 
 or more than common fear of clifford 's rigour , 
 who thunder to hi captiv blood and death , 
 i can not judg ; but , to conclud with truth , 
 their weapon like to lightn came and went : 
 our soldier ' , like the night-owl 's lazi flight 
 or like an idl thresher with a flail , 
 fell gentli down , as if they struck their friend . 
 i cheer 'd them up with justic of our caus , 
 with promis of high pay and great reward , 
 but all in vain ; they had no heart to fight , 
 and we in them no hope to win the day ; 
 so that we fled : the king unto the queen ; 
 lord georg your brother , norfolk , and myself , 
 in hast post-hast are come to join with you ; 
 for in the march here we heard you were 
 make anoth head to fight again . 
 edward . where is the duke of norfolk , gentl warwick ? 
 and when came georg from burgundi to england ? 
 warwick . some six mile off the duke is with the soldier ; 
 and for your brother , he wa late sent 
 from your kind aunt , duchess of burgundi , 
 with aid of soldier to thi need war . 
 richard . 't wa odd , belik , when valiant warwick fled . 
 oft have i heard hi prais in pursuit , 
 but ne'er till now hi scandal of retir . 
 warwick . nor now my scandal , richard , dost thou hear ; 
 for thou shalt know thi strong right hand of mine 
 can pluck the diadem from faint henri 's head 
 and wring the aw sceptr from hi fist , 
 were he as famou and as bold in war 
 as he is fam 'd for mild , peac , and prayer . 
 richard . i know it well , lord warwick ; blame me not . 
 't is love i bear thi glori make me speak . 
 but in thi troublou time what 's to be done ? 
 shall we go throw away our coat of steel 
 and wrap our bodi in black mourning-gown , 
 number our ave-mari with our bead ? 
 or shall we on the helmet of our foe 
 tell our devot with reveng arm ? 
 if for the last , say 'ay , ' and to it , lord . 
 warwick . whi , therefor warwick came to seek you out ; 
 and therefor come my brother montagu . 
 attend me , lord . the proud insult queen , 
 with clifford and the haught northumberland , 
 and of their feather mani moe proud bird , 
 have wrought the easy-melt king like wax . 
 he swore consent to your success , 
 hi oath enrol in the parliament ; 
 and now to london all the crew are gone 
 to frustrat both hi oath and what besid 
 may make against the hous of lancast . 
 their power , i think , is thirti thousand strong . 
 now if the help of norfolk and myself , 
 with all the friend that thou , brave earl of march , 
 amongst the love welshmen canst procur , 
 will but amount to five and twenti thousand , 
 whi , via ! to london will we march amain , 
 and onc again bestrid our foam steed , 
 and onc again cri 'charg upon our foe ! ' 
 but never onc again turn back and fli . 
 richard . ay , now methink i hear great warwick speak . 
 ne'er may he live to see a sunshin day 
 that cri 'retir ! ' if warwick bid him stay . 
 edward . lord warwick , on thi shoulder will i lean ; 
 and when thou fail'st- as god forbid the hour ! - 
 must edward fall , which peril heaven forfend . 
 warwick . no longer earl of march , but duke of york ; 
 the next degre is england 's royal throne , 
 for king of england shalt thou be proclaim 'd 
 in everi borough as we pass along ; 
 and he that throw not up hi cap for joy 
 shall for the fault make forfeit of hi head . 
 king edward , valiant richard , montagu , 
 stay we no longer , dream of renown , 
 but sound the trumpet and about our task . 
 richard . then , clifford , were thi heart as hard as steel , 
 as thou hast shown it flinti by thi deed , 
 i come to pierc it or to give thee mine . 
 edward . then strike up drum . god and saint georg for us ! 
 
 enter a messeng 
 
 warwick . how now ! what news ? 
 messeng . the duke of norfolk send you word by me 
 the queen is come with a puissant host , 
 and crave your compani for speedi counsel . 
 warwick . whi , then it sort ; brave warrior , let 's away .

 queen margaret . welcom , my lord , to thi brave town of york . 
 yonder 's the head of that arch-enemi 
 that sought to be encompass 'd with your crown . 
 doth not the object cheer your heart , my lord ? 
 king henri . ay , as the rock cheer them that fear their wreck- 
 to see thi sight , it irk my veri soul . 
 withhold reveng , dear god ; 't is not my fault , 
 nor wittingli have i infr 'd my vow . 
 clifford . my graciou lieg , thi too much leniti 
 and harm piti must be laid asid . 
 to whom do lion cast their gentl look ? 
 not to the beast that would usurp their den . 
 whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick ? 
 not hi that spoil her young befor her face . 
 who scape the lurk serpent 's mortal sting ? 
 not he that set hi foot upon her back , 
 the smallest worm will turn , be trodden on , 
 and dove will peck in safeguard of their brood . 
 ambiti york did level at thi crown , 
 thou smile while he knit hi angri brow . 
 he , but a duke , would have hi son a king , 
 and rais hi issu like a love sire : 
 thou , be a king , bless 'd with a goodli son , 
 didst yield consent to disinherit him , 
 which argu thee a most unlov father . 
 unreason creatur feed their young ; 
 and though man 's face be fear to their eye , 
 yet , in protect of their tender one , 
 who hath not seen them- even with those wing 
 which sometim they have us 'd with fear flight- 
 make war with him that climb 'd unto their nest , 
 offer their own live in their young 's defenc 
 for shame , my lieg , make them your preced ! 
 were it not piti that thi goodli boy 
 should lose hi birthright by hi father 's fault , 
 and long hereaft say unto hi child 
 'what my great-grandfath and grandsir got 
 my careless father fondli gave away ' ? 
 ah , what a shame were thi ! look on the boy ; 
 and let hi manli face , which promiseth

 king henri . full well hath clifford play 'd the orat , 
 infer argument of mighti forc . 
 but , clifford , tell me , didst thou never hear 
 that thing ill got had ever bad success ? 
 and happi alway wa it for that son 
 whose father for hi hoard went to hell ? 
 i 'll leav my son my virtuou deed behind ; 
 and would my father had left me no more ! 
 for all the rest is held at such a rate 
 as bring a thousand-fold more care to keep 
 than in possess ani jot of pleasur . 
 ah , cousin york ! would thi best friend did know 
 how it doth griev me that thi head is here ! 
 queen margaret . my lord , cheer up your spirit ; our foe are nigh , 
 and thi soft courag make your follow faint .

 and set thi diadem upon my head , 
 or bide the mortal fortun of the field ? 
 queen margaret . go rate thi minion , proud insult boy . 
 becom it thee to be thu bold in term 
 befor thi sovereign and thi law king ? 
 edward . i am hi king , and he should bow hi knee . 
 i wa adopt heir by hi consent : 
 sinc when , hi oath is broke ; for , as i hear , 
 you that are king , though he do wear the crown , 
 have cau 'd him by new act of parliament 
 to blot out me and put hi own son in . 
 clifford . and reason too : 
 who should succeed the father but the son ? 
 richard . are you there , butcher ? o , i can not speak ! 
 clifford . ay , crook-back , here i stand to answer thee , 
 or ani he , the proudest of thi sort . 
 richard . 't wa you that kill 'd young rutland , wa it not ? 
 clifford . ay , and old york , and yet not satisfi . 
 richard . for god 's sake , lord , give signal to the fight . 
 warwick . what say'st thou , henri ? wilt thou yield the crown ? 
 queen margaret . whi , how now , long-tongu 'd warwick ! dare you speak ? 
 when you and i met at saint alban last 
 your leg did better servic than your hand . 
 warwick . then 't wa my turn to fli , and now 't is thine . 
 clifford . you said so much befor , and yet you fled . 
 warwick . 't wa not your valour , clifford , drove me thenc . 
 northumberland . no , nor your manhood that durst make you stay . 
 richard . northumberland , i hold thee rever . 
 break off the parley ; for scarc i can refrain 
 the execut of my big-swol'n heart 
 upon that clifford , that cruel child-kil . 
 clifford . i slew thi father ; call'st thou him a child ? 
 richard . ay , like a dastard and a treacher coward , 
 as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland ; 
 but ere sunset i 'll make thee curs the deed . 
 king henri . have done with word , my lord , and hear me speak . 
 queen margaret . defi them then , or els hold close thi lip . 
 king henri . i prithe give no limit to my tongu : 
 i am a king , and privileg 'd to speak . 
 clifford . my lieg , the wound that bred thi meet here 
 can not be cur 'd by word ; therefor be still . 
 richard . then , execution , unsheath thi sword . 
 by him that made us all , i am resolv 'd 
 that clifford 's manhood lie upon hi tongu . 
 edward . say , henri , shall i have my right , or no ? 
 a thousand men have broke their fast to-day 
 that ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown . 
 warwick . if thou deni , their blood upon thi head ; 
 for york in justic put hi armour on . 
 princ of wale . if that be right which warwick say is right , 
 there is no wrong , but everi thing is right . 
 richard . whoever got thee , there thi mother stand ; 
 for well i wot thou hast thi mother 's tongu . 
 queen margaret . but thou art neither like thi sire nor dam ; 
 but like a foul misshapen stigmat , 
 mark 'd by the destini to be avoid , 
 as venom toad or lizard ' dread sting . 
 richard . iron of napl hid with english gilt , 
 whose father bear the titl of a king- 
 as if a channel should be call 'd the sea- 
 sham'st thou not , know whenc thou art extraught , 
 to let thi tongu detect thi base-born heart ? 
 edward . a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crown 
 to make thi shameless callet know herself . 
 helen of greec wa fairer far than thou , 
 although thi husband may be menelau ; 
 and ne'er wa agamemmon 's brother wrong 'd 
 by that fals woman as thi king by thee . 
 hi father revel 'd in the heart of franc , 
 and tam 'd the king , and made the dauphin stoop ; 
 and had he match 'd accord to hi state , 
 he might have kept that glori to thi day ; 
 but when he took a beggar to hi bed 
 and grac 'd thi poor sire with hi bridal day , 
 even then that sunshin brew 'd a show ' r for him 
 that wash 'd hi father 's fortun forth of franc 
 and heap 'd sedit on hi crown at home . 
 for what hath broach 'd thi tumult but thi pride ? 
 hadst thou been meek , our titl still had slept ; 
 and we , in piti of the gentl king , 
 had slipp 'd our claim until anoth age . 
 georg . but when we saw our sunshin made thi spring , 
 and that thi summer bred us no increas , 
 we set the axe to thi usurp root ; 
 and though the edg hath someth hit ourselv , 
 yet know thou , sinc we have begun to strike , 
 we 'll never leav till we have hewn thee down , 
 or bath 'd thi grow with our heat blood . 
 edward . and in thi resolut i defi thee ; 
 not will ani longer confer , 
 sinc thou deniest the gentl king to speak . 
 sound trumpet ; let our bloodi colour wave , 
 and either victori or els a grave ! 
 queen margaret . stay , edward . 
 edward . no , wrangl woman , we 'll no longer stay ; 
 these word will cost ten thousand live thi day .

 king henri . thi battl fare like to the morn 's war , 
 when die cloud contend with grow light , 
 what time the shepherd , blow of hi nail , 
 can neither call it perfect day nor night . 
 now sway it thi way , like a mighti sea 
 forc 'd by the tide to combat with the wind ; 
 now sway it that way , like the selfsam sea 
 forc 'd to retir by furi of the wind . 
 sometim the flood prevail , and then the wind ; 
 now one the better , then anoth best ; 
 both tug to be victor , breast to breast , 
 yet neither conqueror nor conquer . 
 so is the equal pois of thi fell war . 
 here on thi molehil will i sit me down . 
 to whom god will , there be the victori ! 
 for margaret my queen , and clifford too , 
 have chid me from the battl , swear both 
 they prosper best of all when i am thenc . 
 would i were dead , if god 's good will were so ! 
 for what is in thi world but grief and woe ? 
 o god ! methink it were a happi life 
 to be no better than a home swain ; 
 to sit upon a hill , as i do now , 
 to carv out dial quaintli , point by point , 
 therebi to see the minut how they run- 
 how mani make the hour full complet , 
 how mani hour bring about the day , 
 how mani day will finish up the year , 
 how mani year a mortal man may live . 
 when thi is known , then to divid the times- 
 so mani hour must i tend my flock ; 
 so mani hour must i take my rest ; 
 so mani hour must i contempl ; 
 so mani hour must i sport myself ; 
 so mani day my ewe have been with young ; 
 so mani week ere the poor fool will can ; 
 so mani year ere i shall shear the fleec : 
 so minut , hour , day , month , and year , 
 pass 'd over to the end they were creat , 
 would bring white hair unto a quiet grave . 
 ah , what a life were thi ! how sweet ! how love ! 
 give not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade 
 to shepherd look on their silli sheep ,

 o ye , it doth ; a thousand-fold it doth . 
 and to conclud : the shepherd 's home curd , 
 hi cold thin drink out of hi leather bottl , 
 hi wont sleep under a fresh tree 's shade , 
 all which secur and sweetli he enjoy ,

 thi burn car never had scorch 'd the earth ! 
 and , henri , hadst thou sway 'd as king should do , 
 or as thi father and hi father did , 
 give no ground unto the hous of york , 
 they never then had sprung like summer fli ; 
 i and ten thousand in thi luckless realm 
 had left no mourn widow for our death ; 
 and thou thi day hadst kept thi chair in peac . 
 for what doth cherish weed but gentl air ? 
 and what make robber bold but too much leniti ? 
 bootless are plaint , and cureless are my wound . 
 no way to fli , nor strength to hold out flight . 
 the foe is merciless and will not piti ; 
 for at their hand i have deserv 'd no piti . 
 the air hath got into my deadli wound ,

 but think you , lord , that clifford fled with them ?

 for , though befor hi face i speak the word , 
 your brother richard mark 'd him for the grave ; 
 and , whereso' he is , he 's sure dead .

 but set hi murd'r knife unto the root 
 from whenc that tender spray did sweetli spring- 
 i mean our princ father , duke of york . 
 warwick . from off the gate of york fetch down the head , 
 your father 's head , which clifford place there ; 
 instead whereof let thi suppli the room .

 now death shall stop hi dismal threat'n sound , 
 and hi ill-bod tongu no more shall speak . 
 warwick . i think hi understand is bereft .

 dark cloudi death o'ershad hi beam of life , 
 and he nor see nor hear us what we say . 
 richard . o , would he did ! and so , perhap , he doth . 
 't is but hi polici to counterfeit , 
 becaus he would avoid such bitter taunt 
 which in the time of death he gave our father . 
 georg . if so thou think'st , vex him with eager word . 
 richard . clifford , ask merci and obtain no grace . 
 edward . clifford , repent in bootless penit .

 warwick . they mock thee , clifford ; swear as thou wast wont . 
 richard . what , not an oath ? nay , then the world goe hard 
 when clifford can not spare hi friend an oath . 
 i know by that he 's dead ; and by my soul , 
 if thi right hand would buy two hour ' life , 
 that i in all despit might rail at him , 
 thi hand should chop it off , and with the issu blood 
 stifl the villain whose unstanch thirst 
 york and young rutland could not satisfi . 
 warwick . ay , but he 's dead . off with the traitor 's head , 
 and rear it in the place your father 's stand . 
 and now to london with triumphant march , 
 there to be crown england 's royal king ; 
 from whenc shall warwick cut the sea to franc , 
 and ask the ladi bona for thi queen . 
 so shalt thou sinew both these land togeth ; 
 and , have franc thi friend , thou shalt not dread 
 the scatt'r foe that hope to rise again ; 
 for though they can not greatli sting to hurt , 
 yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ear . 
 first will i see the coron ; 
 and then to brittani i 'll cross the sea 
 to effect thi marriag , so it pleas my lord . 
 edward . even as thou wilt , sweet warwick , let it be ; 
 for in thi shoulder do i build my seat , 
 and never will i undertak the thing 
 wherein thi counsel and consent is want . 
 richard , i will creat thee duke of gloucest ;

 second keeper . i 'll stay abov the hill , so both may shoot . 
 first keeper . that can not be ; the nois of thi cross-bow

 here stand we both , and aim we at the best ; 
 and , for the time shall not seem tediou ,

 to greet mine own land with my wish sight . 
 no , harri , harri , 't is no land of thine ; 
 thi place is fill 'd , thi sceptr wrung from thee , 
 thi balm wash 'd off wherewith thou wast anoint . 
 no bend knee will call thee caesar now , 
 no humbl suitor press to speak for right , 
 no , not a man come for redress of thee ; 
 for how can i help them and not myself ? 
 first keeper . ay , here 's a deer whose skin 's a keeper 's fee . 
 thi is the quondam king ; let 's seiz upon him . 
 king henri . let me embrac thee , sour advers ,

 king henri . my queen and son are gone to franc for aid ; 
 and , as i hear , the great command warwick 
 is thither gone to crave the french king 's sister 
 to wife for edward . if thi news be true , 
 poor queen and son , your labour is but lost ; 
 for warwick is a subtl orat , 
 and lewi a princ soon won with move word . 
 by thi account , then , margaret may win him ; 
 for she 's a woman to be piti much . 
 her sigh will make a batt'ri in hi breast ; 
 her tear will pierc into a marbl heart ; 
 the tiger will be mild while she doth mourn ; 
 and nero will be taint with remors 
 to hear and see her plaint , her brinish tear . 
 ay , but she 's come to beg : warwick , to give . 
 she , on hi left side , crave aid for henri : 
 he , on hi right , ask a wife for edward . 
 she weep , and say her henri is depo 'd :

 while warwick tell hi titl , smooth the wrong , 
 inferreth argument of mighti strength , 
 and in conclus win the king from her 
 with promis of hi sister , and what els , 
 to strengthen and support king edward 's place . 
 o margaret , thu 'twill be ; and thou , poor soul , 
 art then forsaken , as thou went'st forlorn ! 
 second keeper . say , what art thou that talk'st of king and queen ? 
 king henri . more than i seem , and less than i wa born to : 
 a man at least , for less i should not be ; 
 and men may talk of king , and whi not i ? 
 second keeper . ay , but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king . 
 king henri . whi , so i am- in mind ; and that 's enough . 
 second keeper . but , if thou be a king , where is thi crown ? 
 king henri . my crown is in my heart , not on my head ; 
 not deck 'd with diamond and indian stone , 
 not to be seen . my crown is call 'd content ; 
 a crown it is that seldom king enjoy . 
 second keeper . well , if you be a king crown 'd with content , 
 your crown content and you must be content 
 to go along with us ; for as we think , 
 you are the king king edward hath depo 'd ; 
 and we hi subject , sworn in all allegi , 
 will apprehend you as hi enemi . 
 king henri . but did you never swear , and break an oath ? 
 second keeper . no , never such an oath ; nor will not now . 
 king henri . where did you dwell when i wa king of england ? 
 second keeper . here in thi countri , where we now remain . 
 king henri . i wa anoint king at nine month old ; 
 my father and my grandfath were king ; 
 and you were sworn true subject unto me ; 
 and tell me , then , have you not broke your oath ? 
 first keeper . no ; 
 for we were subject but while you were king . 
 king henri . whi , am i dead ? do i not breath a man ? 
 ah , simpl men , you know not what you swear !

 and as the air blow it to me again ,

 and yield to anoth when it blow ,

 such is the light of you common men . 
 but do not break your oath ; for of that sin 
 my mild entreati shall not make you guilti . 
 go where you will , the king shall be command ; 
 and be you king : command , and i 'll obey . 
 first keeper . we are true subject to the king , king edward .

 and all the unlook 'd for issu of their bodi , 
 to take their room ere i can place myself . 
 a cold premedit for my purpos ! 
 whi , then i do but dream on sovereignti ; 
 like one that stand upon a promontori 
 and spi a far-off shore where he would tread , 
 wish hi foot were equal with hi eye ; 
 and chide the sea that sunder him from thenc , 
 say he 'll lade it dri to have hi way- 
 so do i wish the crown , be so far off ; 
 and so i chide the mean that keep me from it ; 
 and so i say i 'll cut the caus off , 
 flatter me with imposs . 
 my eye 's too quick , my heart o'erween too much , 
 unless my hand and strength could equal them . 
 well , say there is no kingdom then for richard ; 
 what other pleasur can the world afford ? 
 i 'll make my heaven in a ladi 's lap , 
 and deck my bodi in gay ornament , 
 and witch sweet ladi with my word and look . 
 o miser thought ! and more unlik 
 than to accomplish twenti golden crown . 
 whi , love forswor me in my mother 's womb ; 
 and , for i should not deal in her soft law , 
 she did corrupt frail natur with some bribe 
 to shrink mine arm up like a wither 'd shrub 
 to make an enviou mountain on my back , 
 where sit deform to mock my bodi ; 
 to shape my leg of an unequ size ; 
 to disproport me in everi part , 
 like to a chao , or an unlick 'd bear-whelp 
 that carri no impress like the dam . 
 and am i , then , a man to be belov 'd ? 
 o monstrou fault to harbour such a thought ! 
 then , sinc thi earth afford no joy to me 
 but to command , to check , to o'erbear such 
 as are of better person than myself , 
 i 'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown , 
 and while i live t ' account thi world but hell , 
 until my misshap 'd trunk that bear thi head 
 be round impal with a gloriou crown . 
 and yet i know not how to get the crown , 
 for mani live stand between me and home ; 
 and i- like one lost in a thorni wood 
 that rent the thorn and is rent with the thorn , 
 seek a way and stray from the way 
 not know how to find the open air , 
 but toil desper to find it out- 
 torment myself to catch the english crown ; 
 and from that torment i will free myself 
 or hew my way out with a bloodi axe . 
 whi , i can smile , and murder while i smile , 
 and cri 'content ! ' to that which griev my heart , 
 and wet my cheek with artifici tear , 
 and frame my face to all occas . 
 i 'll drown more sailor than the mermaid shall ; 
 i 'll slay more gazer than the basilisk ; 
 i 'll play the orat as well as nestor , 
 deceiv more slili than ulyss could , 
 and , like a sinon , take anoth troy . 
 i can add colour to the chameleon , 
 chang shape with protheu for advantag , 
 and set the murder machiavel to school . 
 can i do thi , and can not get a crown ? 
 tut , were it farther off , i 'll pluck it down . exit 
 
 
 
 
 scene iii . 
 franc . the king 's palac 
 
 flourish . enter lewi the french king , hi sister bona , 
 hi admir call 'd bourbon ; princ edward , queen margaret , 
 and the earl of oxford . lewi sit , and riseth up again 
 
 lewi . fair queen of england , worthi margaret , 
 sit down with us . it ill befit thi state 
 and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewi doth sit . 
 queen margaret . no , mighti king of franc . now margaret 
 must strike her sail and learn a while to serv 
 where king command . i wa , i must confess , 
 great albion 's queen in former golden day ; 
 but now mischanc hath trod my titl down 
 and with dishonour laid me on the ground , 
 where i must take like seat unto my fortun , 
 and to my humbl seat conform myself . 
 lewi . whi , say , fair queen , whenc spring thi deep despair ? 
 queen margaret . from such a caus as fill mine eye with tear 
 and stop my tongu , while heart is drown 'd in care . 
 lewi . whate' it be , be thou still like thyself , 
 and sit thee by our side . [ seat her by him ] yield not thi neck 
 to fortun 's yoke , but let thi dauntless mind 
 still ride in triumph over all mischanc . 
 be plain , queen margaret , and tell thi grief ; 
 it shall be ea 'd , if franc can yield relief . 
 queen margaret . those graciou word reviv my droop thought 
 and give my tongue-ti sorrow leav to speak . 
 now therefor be it known to nobl lewi 
 that henri , sole possessor of my love , 
 is , of a king , becom a banish 'd man , 
 and forc 'd to live in scotland a forlorn ; 
 while proud ambiti edward duke of york 
 usurp the regal titl and the seat 
 of england 's true-anoint law king . 
 thi is the caus that i , poor margaret , 
 with thi my son , princ edward , henri 's heir , 
 am come to crave thi just and law aid ; 
 and if thou fail us , all our hope is done . 
 scotland hath will to help , but can not help ; 
 our peopl and our peer are both misl , 
 our treasur seiz 'd , our soldier put to flight , 
 and , as thou seest , ourselv in heavi plight . 
 lewi . renown queen , with patienc calm the storm , 
 while we bethink a mean to break it off . 
 queen margaret . the more we stay , the stronger grow our foe . 
 lewi . the more i stay , the more i 'll succour thee . 
 queen margaret . o , but impati waiteth on true sorrow . 
 and see where come the breeder of my sorrow ! 
 
 enter warwick 
 
 lewi . what 's he approacheth boldli to our presenc ? 
 queen margaret . our earl of warwick , edward 's greatest friend . 
 lewi . welcom , brave warwick ! what bring thee to franc ? 
 [ he descend . she ariseth ] 
 queen margaret . ay , now begin a second storm to rise ; 
 for thi is he that move both wind and tide . 
 warwick . from worthi edward , king of albion , 
 my lord and sovereign , and thi vow friend , 
 i come , in kind and unfeign love , 
 first to do greet to thi royal person , 
 and then to crave a leagu of amiti , 
 and lastli to confirm that amiti 
 with nuptial knot , if thou vouchsaf to grant 
 that virtuou ladi bona , thi fair sister , 
 to england 's king in law marriag . 
 queen margaret . [ asid ] if that go forward , henri 's hope is done . 
 warwick . [ to bona ] and , graciou madam , in our king 's behalf , 
 i am command , with your leav and favour , 
 humbl to kiss your hand , and with my tongu 
 to tell the passion of my sovereign 's heart ; 
 where fame , late ent'r at hi heed ear , 
 hath plac 'd thi beauti 's imag and thi virtu . 
 queen margaret . king lewi and ladi bona , hear me speak 
 befor you answer warwick . hi demand 
 spring not from edward 's well-meant honest love , 
 but from deceit bred by necess ; 
 for how can tyrant safe govern home 
 unless abroad they purchas great allianc ? 
 to prove him tyrant thi reason may suffic , 
 that henri liveth still ; but were he dead , 
 yet here princ edward stand , king henri 's son . 
 look therefor , lewi , that by thi leagu and marriag 
 thou draw not on thi danger and dishonour ; 
 for though usurp sway the rule a while 
 yet heav'n are just , and time suppresseth wrong . 
 warwick . injuri margaret ! 
 princ of wale . and whi not queen ? 
 warwick . becaus thi father henri did usurp ; 
 and thou no more art princ than she is queen . 
 oxford . then warwick disannul great john of gaunt , 
 which did subdu the greatest part of spain ; 
 and , after john of gaunt , henri the fourth , 
 whose wisdom wa a mirror to the wisest ; 
 and , after that wise princ , henri the fifth , 
 who by hi prowess conquer all franc . 
 from these our henri lineal descend . 
 warwick . oxford , how hap it in thi smooth discours 
 you told not how henri the sixth hath lost 
 all that which henri the fifth had gotten ? 
 methink these peer of franc should smile at that . 
 but for the rest : you tell a pedigre 
 of threescor and two years- a silli time 
 to make prescript for a kingdom 's worth . 
 oxford . whi , warwick , canst thou speak against thi lieg , 
 whom thou obeyed'st thirti and six year , 
 and not betray thi treason with a blush ? 
 warwick . can oxford that did ever fenc the right 
 now buckler falsehood with a pedigre ? 
 for shame ! leav henri , and call edward king . 
 oxford . call him my king by whose injuri doom 
 my elder brother , the lord aubrey vere , 
 wa done to death ; and more than so , my father , 
 even in the downfal of hi mellow 'd year , 
 when natur brought him to the door of death ? 
 no , warwick , no ; while life uphold thi arm , 
 thi arm uphold the hous of lancast . 
 warwick . and i the hous of york . 
 lewi . queen margaret , princ edward , and oxford , 
 vouchsaf at our request to stand asid 
 while i use further confer with warwick . 
 [ they stand aloof ] 
 queen margaret . heaven grant that warwick 's word bewitch him not ! 
 lewi . now , warwick , tell me , even upon thi conscienc , 
 is edward your true king ? for i were loath 
 to link with him that were not law chosen . 
 warwick . thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour . 
 lewi . but is he graciou in the peopl 's eye ? 
 warwick . the more that henri wa unfortun . 
 lewi . then further : all dissembl set asid , 
 tell me for truth the measur of hi love 
 unto our sister bona . 
 warwick . such it seem 
 as may beseem a monarch like himself . 
 myself have often heard him say and swear 
 that thi hi love wa an etern plant 
 whereof the root wa fix 'd in virtu 's ground , 
 the leav and fruit maintain 'd with beauti 's sun , 
 exempt from envi , but not from disdain , 
 unless the ladi bona quit hi pain . 
 lewi . now , sister , let us hear your firm resolv . 
 bona . your grant or your denial shall be mine . 
 [ to warwick ] yet i confess that often ere thi day , 
 when i have heard your king 's desert recount , 
 mine ear hath tempt judgment to desir . 
 lewi . then , warwick , thu : our sister shall be edward 's . 
 and now forthwith shall articl be drawn 
 touch the jointur that your king must make , 
 which with her dowri shall be counterpoi 'd . 
 draw near , queen margaret , and be a wit 
 that bona shall be wife to the english king . 
 princ of wale . to edward , but not to the english king . 
 queen margaret . deceit warwick , it wa thi devic 
 by thi allianc to make void my suit . 
 befor thi come , lewi wa henri 's friend . 
 lewi . and still is friend to him and margaret . 
 but if your titl to the crown be weak , 
 as may appear by edward 's good success , 
 then 't is but reason that i be relea 'd 
 from give aid which late i promis . 
 yet shall you have all kind at my hand 
 that your estat requir and mine can yield . 
 warwick . henri now live in scotland at hi case , 
 where have noth , noth can he lose . 
 and as for you yourself , our quondam queen , 
 you have a father abl to maintain you , 
 and better 'twere you troubl him than franc . 
 queen margaret . peac , impud and shameless warwick , 
 proud setter up and puller down of king ! 
 i will not henc till with my talk and tear , 
 both full of truth , i make king lewi behold 
 thi sli convey and thi lord 's fals love ; 
 for both of you are bird of self-sam feather . 
 [ post blow a horn within ] 
 lewi . warwick , thi is some post to us or thee . 
 
 enter the post

 lewi . what , ha your king marri the ladi grey ? 
 and now , to sooth your forgeri and hi , 
 send me a paper to persuad me patienc ? 
 is thi th ' allianc that he seek with franc ? 
 dare he presum to scorn us in thi manner ? 
 queen margaret . i told your majesti as much befor . 
 thi proveth edward 's love and warwick 's honesti . 
 warwick . king lewi , i here protest in sight of heaven , 
 and by the hope i have of heavenli bliss , 
 that i am clear from thi misde of edward's- 
 no more my king , for he dishonour me , 
 but most himself , if he could see hi shame . 
 did i forget that by the hous of york 
 my father came untim to hi death ? 
 did i let pass th ' abus done to my niec ? 
 did i impal him with the regal crown ? 
 did i put henri from hi nativ right ? 
 and am i guerdon 'd at the last with shame ? 
 shame on himself ! for my desert is honour ; 
 and to repair my honour lost for him 
 i here renounc him and return to henri . 
 my nobl queen , let former grudg pass , 
 and henceforth i am thi true servitor . 
 i will reveng hi wrong to ladi bona , 
 and replant henri in hi former state . 
 queen margaret . warwick , these word have turn 'd my hate to love ; 
 and i forgiv and quit forget old fault , 
 and joy that thou becom'st king henri 's friend . 
 warwick . so much hi friend , ay , hi unfeign friend , 
 that if king lewi vouchsaf to furnish us 
 with some few band of chosen soldier , 
 i 'll undertak to land them on our coast 
 and forc the tyrant from hi seat by war . 
 't is not hi new-mad bride shall succour him ; 
 and as for clarenc , as my letter tell me , 
 he 's veri like now to fall from him 
 for match more for wanton lust than honour 
 or than for strength and safeti of our countri . 
 bona . dear brother , how shall bona be reveng 'd 
 but by thi help to thi distress queen ? 
 queen margaret . renown princ , how shall poor henri live 
 unless thou rescu him from foul despair ? 
 bona . my quarrel and thi english queen 's are one . 
 warwick . and mine , fair ladi bona , join with your . 
 lewi . and mine with her , and thine , and margaret 's . 
 therefor , at last , i firmli am resolv 'd 
 you shall have aid .

 lewi . then , england 's messeng , return in post 
 and tell fals edward , thi suppos king ,

 to revel it with him and hi new bride .

 i 'll wear the willow-garland for hi sake . 
 queen margaret . tell him my mourn weed are laid asid , 
 and i am readi to put armour on . 
 warwick . tell him from me that he hath done me wrong , 
 and therefor i 'll uncrown him ere't be long . 
 there 's thi reward ; be gone . exit post 
 lewi . but , warwick ,

 gloucest . now tell me , brother clarenc , what think you 
 of thi new marriag with the ladi grey ? 
 hath not our brother made a worthi choic ? 
 clarenc . ala , you know 't is far from henc to franc ! 
 how could he stay till warwick made return ? 
 somerset . my lord , forbear thi talk ; here come the king . 
 
 flourish . enter king edward , attend ; ladi 
 grey , as queen ; pembrok , stafford , hast , 
 and other . four stand on one side , and four on the other 
 
 gloucest . and hi well-chosen bride . 
 clarenc . i mind to tell him plainli what i think . 
 king edward . now , brother of clarenc , how like you our choic 
 that you stand pensiv as half malcont ? 
 clarenc . as well as lewi of franc or the earl of warwick , 
 which are so weak of courag and in judgment 
 that they 'll take no offenc at our abus . 
 king edward . suppos they take offenc without a caus ; 
 they are but lewi and warwick : i am edward , 
 your king and warwick 's and must have my will . 
 gloucest . and shall have your will , becaus our king . 
 yet hasti marriag seldom proveth well . 
 king edward . yea , brother richard , are you offend too ? 
 gloucest . not i . 
 no , god forbid that i should wish them sever 'd 
 whom god hath join 'd togeth ; ay , and 'twere piti 
 to sunder them that yoke so well togeth . 
 king edward . set your scorn and your mislik asid , 
 tell me some reason whi the ladi grey 
 should not becom my wife and england 's queen . 
 and you too , somerset and montagu , 
 speak freeli what you think . 
 clarenc . then thi is mine opinion : that king lewi 
 becom your enemi for mock him 
 about the marriag of the ladi bona . 
 gloucest . and warwick , do what you gave in charg , 
 is now dishonour by thi new marriag . 
 king edward . what if both lewi and warwick be appea 'd 
 by such invent as i can devis ? 
 montagu . yet to have join 'd with franc in such allianc 
 would more have strength'n thi our commonwealth 
 'gainst foreign storm than ani home-br marriag . 
 hast . whi , know not montagu that of itself 
 england is safe , if true within itself ? 
 montagu . but the safer when 't is back 'd with franc . 
 hast . 't is better use franc than trust franc . 
 let us be back 'd with god , and with the sea 
 which he hath giv'n for fenc impregn , 
 and with their help onli defend ourselv . 
 in them and in ourselv our safeti lie . 
 clarenc . for thi one speech lord hast well deserv 
 to have the heir of the lord hungerford . 
 king edward . ay , what of that ? it wa my will and grant ; 
 and for thi onc my will shall stand for law . 
 gloucest . and yet methink your grace hath not done well 
 to give the heir and daughter of lord scale 
 unto the brother of your love bride . 
 she better would have fit me or clarenc ; 
 but in your bride you buri brotherhood . 
 clarenc . or els you would not have bestow 'd the heir 
 of the lord bonvil on your new wife 's son , 
 and leav your brother to go speed elsewher . 
 king edward . ala , poor clarenc ! is it for a wife 
 that thou art malcont ? i will provid thee . 
 clarenc . in choos for yourself you show 'd your judgment , 
 which be shallow , you shall give me leav 
 to play the broker in mine own behalf ; 
 and to that end i shortli mind to leav you . 
 king edward . leav me or tarri , edward will be king , 
 and not be tie unto hi brother 's will . 
 queen elizabeth . my lord , befor it plea 'd hi majesti 
 to rais my state to titl of a queen , 
 do me but right , and you must all confess 
 that i wa not ignobl of descent : 
 and meaner than myself have had like fortun . 
 but as thi titl honour me and mine , 
 so your dislik , to whom i would be pleas , 
 doth cloud my joy with danger and with sorrow . 
 king edward . my love , forbear to fawn upon their frown . 
 what danger or what sorrow can befal thee , 
 so long as edward is thi constant friend 
 and their true sovereign whom they must obey ? 
 nay , whom they shall obey , and love thee too , 
 unless they seek for hatr at my hand ; 
 which if they do , yet will i keep thee safe , 
 and they shall feel the vengeanc of my wrath . 
 gloucest . [ asid ] i hear , yet say not much , but think the more .

 king edward . is lewi so brave ? belik he think me henri . 
 but what said ladi bona to my marriag ? 
 messeng . these were her word , utt'r with mild disdain : 
 'tell him , in hope he 'll prove a widow shortli , 
 i 'll wear the willow-garland for hi sake . ' 
 king edward . i blame not her : she could say littl less ; 
 she had the wrong . but what said henri 's queen ? 
 for i have heard that she wa there in place . 
 messeng . 'tell him ' quoth she 'mi mourn weed are done , 
 and i am readi to put armour on . ' 
 king edward . belik she mind to play the amazon . 
 but what said warwick to these injuri ? 
 messeng . he , more incen 'd against your majesti 
 than all the rest , discharg 'd me with these word : 
 'tell him from me that he hath done me wrong ; 
 and therefor i 'll uncrown him ere't be long . ' 
 king edward . ha ! durst the traitor breath out so proud word ? 
 well , i will arm me , be thu forewarn 'd . 
 they shall have war and pay for their presumpt . 
 but say , is warwick friend with margaret ? 
 messeng . ay , graciou sovereign ; they are so link 'd in friendship 
 that young princ edward marri warwick 's daughter . 
 clarenc . belik the elder ; clarenc will have the younger . 
 now , brother king , farewel , and sit you fast , 
 for i will henc to warwick 's other daughter ;

 i may not prove inferior to yourself . 
 you that love me and warwick , follow me .

 they are alreadi , or quickli will be land . 
 myself in person will straight follow you . 
 exeunt pembrok and stafford 
 but ere i go , hast and montagu , 
 resolv my doubt . you twain , of all the rest , 
 are near to warwick by blood and by allianc . 
 tell me if you love warwick more than me ? 
 if it be so , then both depart to him : 
 i rather wish you foe than hollow friend . 
 but if you mind to hold your true obedi , 
 give me assur with some friendli vow , 
 that i may never have you in suspect . 
 montagu . so god help montagu as he prove true ! 
 hast . and hast as he favour edward 's caus ! 
 king edward . now , brother richard , will you stand by us ? 
 gloucest . ay , in despit of all that shall withstand you .

 whose enviou gulf did swallow up hi life . 
 ah , kill me with thi weapon , not with word ! 
 my breast can better brook thi dagger 's point 
 than can my ear that tragic histori . 
 but wherefor dost thou come ? is't for my life ? 
 gloucest . think'st thou i am an execution ?

 and mani an orphan 's water-stand eye- 
 men for their son , wive for their husband , 
 orphan for their parent ' timeless death- 
 shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born . 
 the owl shriek 'd at thi birth- an evil sign ; 
 the night-crow cri , abod luckless time ; 
 dog howl 'd , and hideou tempest shook down tree ; 
 the raven rook 'd her on the chimney 's top , 
 and chatt'r pie in dismal discord sung ; 
 thi mother felt more than a mother 's pain , 
 and yet brought forth less than a mother 's hope , 
 to wit , an indigest deform lump , 
 not like the fruit of such a goodli tree . 
 teeth hadst thou in thi head when thou wast born , 
 to signifi thou cam'st to bite the world ; 
 and if the rest be true which i have heard , 
 thou cam'st-

 sink in the ground ? i thought it would have mount . 
 see how my sword weep for the poor king 's death . 
 o , may such purpl tear be alway shed 
 from those that wish the downfal of our hous ! 
 if ani spark of life be yet remain , 
 down , down to hell ; and say i sent thee thither- 
 [ stab him again ] 
 i , that have neither piti , love , nor fear . 
 inde , 't is true that henri told me of ; 
 for i have often heard my mother say 
 i came into the world with my leg forward . 
 had i not reason , think ye , to make hast 
 and seek their ruin that usurp 'd our right ? 
 the midwif wonder 'd ; and the women cri 
 ' o , jesu bless us , he is born with teeth ! ' 
 and so i wa , which plainli signifi 
 that i should snarl , and bite , and play the dog . 
 then , sinc the heaven have shap 'd my bodi so , 
 let hell make crook 'd my mind to answer it . 
 i have no brother , i am like no brother ; 
 and thi word 'love , ' which greybeard call divin , 
 be resid in men like one anoth , 
 and not in me ! i am myself alon . 
 clarenc , bewar ; thou keep'st me from the light , 
 but i will sort a pitchi day for thee ; 
 for i will buzz abroad such propheci 
 that edward shall be fear of hi life ; 
 and then to purg hi fear , i 'll be thi death . 
 king henri and the princ hi son are gone . 
 clarenc , thi turn is next , and then the rest ; 
 count myself but bad till i be best .

 when everyth doe make a gleeful boast ?

 and make a chequer 'd shadow on the ground ; 
 under their sweet shade , aaron , let us sit , 
 and while the babbl echo mock the hound , 
 repli shrilli to the well-tun 'd horn , 
 as if a doubl hunt were heard at onc , 
 let us sit down and mark their yellow nois ;

 when with a happi storm they were surpri 'd , 
 and curtain 'd with a counsel-keep cave-

 tamora . sauci control of my privat step ! 
 had i the pow ' r that some say dian had , 
 thi templ should be plant present 
 with horn , as wa actaeon 's ; and the hound 
 should drive upon thi new-transform limb , 
 unmannerli intrud as thou art ! 
 lavinia . under your patienc , gentl emperess , 
 't is thought you have a goodli gift in horn , 
 and to be doubt that your moor and you

 jove shield your husband from hi hound to-day !

 whi are you sequest'r from all your train ,

 these two have 'tice me hither to thi place . 
 a barren detest vale you see it is : 
 the tree , though summer , yet forlorn and lean , 
 overcom with moss and bale mistleto ; 
 here never shine the sun ; here noth breed , 
 unless the nightli owl or fatal raven . 
 and when they show 'd me thi abhor pit , 
 they told me , here , at dead time of the night , 
 a thousand fiend , a thousand hiss snake , 
 ten thousand swell toad , as mani urchin , 
 would make such fear and confus cri 
 as ani mortal bodi hear it 
 should straight fall mad or els die suddenli . 
 no sooner had they told thi hellish tale 
 but straight they told me they would bind me here 
 unto the bodi of a dismal yew , 
 and leav me to thi miser death . 
 and then they call 'd me foul adulteress , 
 lascivi goth , and all the bitterest term 
 that ever ear did hear to such effect ; 
 and had you not by wondrou fortun come , 
 thi vengeanc on me had they execut . 
 reveng it , as you love your mother 's life , 
 or be ye not henceforth call 'd my children . 
 demetriu . thi is a wit that i am thi son .

 demetriu . stay , madam , here is more belong to her ; 
 first thrash the corn , then after burn the straw . 
 thi minion stood upon her chastiti , 
 upon her nuptial vow , her loyalti , 
 and with that paint hope brave your mighti ; 
 and shall she carri thi unto her grave ? 
 chiron . an if she do , i would i were an eunuch . 
 drag henc her husband to some secret hole , 
 and make hi dead trunk pillow to our lust . 
 tamora . but when ye have the honey we desir ,

 lavinia . sweet lord , entreat her hear me but a word . 
 demetriu . listen , fair madam : let it be your glori 
 to see her tear ; but be your heart to them 
 as unrel flint to drop of rain . 
 lavinia . when did the tiger 's young one teach the dam ? 
 o , do not learn her wrath- she taught it thee ; 
 the milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marbl , 
 even at thi teat thou hadst thi tyranni . 
 yet everi mother breed not son alik : 
 [ to chiron ] do thou entreat her show a woman 's piti . 
 chiron . what , wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard ? 
 lavinia . 't is true , the raven doth not hatch a lark . 
 yet have i heard- o , could i find it now ! - 
 the lion , mov 'd with piti , did endur 
 to have hi princ paw par 'd all away . 
 some say that raven foster forlorn children , 
 the whilst their own bird famish in their nest ; 
 o , be to me , though thi hard heart say no , 
 noth so kind , but someth piti ! 
 tamora . i know not what it mean ; away with her ! 
 lavinia . o , let me teach thee ! for my father 's sake , 
 that gave thee life when well he might have slain thee , 
 be not obdur , open thi deaf ear . 
 tamora . hadst thou in person ne'er offend me , 
 even for hi sake am i pitiless . 
 rememb , boy , i pour 'd forth tear in vain 
 to save your brother from the sacrific ; 
 but fierc andronicu would not relent . 
 therefor away with her , and use her as you will ; 
 the wors to her the better lov 'd of me . 
 lavinia . o tamora , be call 'd a gentl queen , 
 and with thine own hand kill me in thi place ! 
 for 't is not life that i have begg 'd so long ; 
 poor i wa slain when bassianu die . 
 tamora . what beg'st thou , then ? fond woman , let me go . 
 lavinia . 't is present death i beg ; and one thing more , 
 that womanhood deni my tongu to tell : 
 o , keep me from their wors than kill lust , 
 and tumbl me into some loathsom pit , 
 where never man 's eye may behold my bodi ; 
 do thi , and be a charit murder . 
 tamora . so should i rob my sweet son of their fee ;

 demetriu and chiron , drag off lavinia 
 
 tamora . farewel , my son ; see that you make her sure .

 quintu . what , art thou fallen ? what subtl hole is thi , 
 whose mouth is cover with rude-grow brier , 
 upon whose leav are drop of new-sh blood 
 as fresh as morn dew distil 'd on flower ?

 how these were they that made away hi brother . exit 
 martiu . whi dost not comfort me , and help me out 
 from thi unhallow 'd and blood-stain hole ? 
 quintu . i am surpris with an uncouth fear ;

 martiu . to prove thou hast a true divin heart , 
 aaron and thou look down into thi den , 
 and see a fear sight of blood and death . 
 quintu . aaron is gone , and my compassion heart 
 will not permit mine eye onc to behold 
 the thing whereat it trembl by surmis ;

 wa i a child to fear i know not what . 
 martiu . lord bassianu lie beray 'd in blood , 
 all on a heap , like to a slaughter lamb , 
 in thi detest , dark , blood-drink pit . 
 quintu . if it be dark , how dost thou know 't is he ? 
 martiu . upon hi bloodi finger he doth wear 
 a preciou ring that lighten all thi hole , 
 which , like a taper in some monument , 
 doth shine upon the dead man 's earthi cheek , 
 and show the rag entrail of thi pit ; 
 so pale did shine the moon on pyramu 
 when he by night lay bath 'd in maiden blood .

 hath lopp 'd , and hew 'd , and made thi bodi bare 
 of her two branches- those sweet ornament 
 whose circl shadow king have sought to sleep in , 
 and might not gain so great a happi 
 as half thi love ? whi dost not speak to me ?

 fair philomel , whi she but lost her tongu , 
 and in a tediou sampler sew 'd her mind ; 
 but , love niec , that mean is cut from thee . 
 a craftier tereu , cousin , hast thou met , 
 and he hath cut those pretti finger off 
 that could have better sew 'd than philomel .

 trembl like aspen leav upon a lute 
 and make the silken string delight to kiss them , 
 he would not then have touch 'd them for hi life !

 act iii . scene i . 
 rome . a street 
 
 enter the judg , tribun , and senat , with titu ' two son 
 martiu and quintu bound , pass on the stage to the place of execut , 
 and titu go befor , plead 
 
 titu . hear me , grave father ; nobl tribun , stay ! 
 for piti of mine age , whose youth wa spent 
 in danger war whilst you secur slept ; 
 for all my blood in rome 's great quarrel shed , 
 for all the frosti night that i have watch 'd , 
 and for these bitter tear , which now you see 
 fill the age wrinkl in my cheek , 
 be piti to my condemn son , 
 whose soul are not corrupt as 't is thought . 
 for two and twenti son i never wept , 
 becaus they die in honour 's lofti bed . 
 [ andronicu lieth down , and the judg 
 pass by him with the prison , and exeunt ] 
 for these , tribun , in the dust i write 
 my heart 's deep languor and my soul 's sad tear . 
 let my tear stanch the earth 's dri appetit ; 
 my son ' sweet blood will make it shame and blush . 
 o earth , i will befriend thee more with rain 
 that shall distil from these two ancient urn , 
 than youth april shall with all hi show'r . 
 in summer 's drought i 'll drop upon thee still ; 
 in winter with warm tear i 'll melt the snow 
 and keep etern spring-tim on thi face , 
 so thou refus to drink my dear son ' blood . 
 
 enter luciu with hi weapon drawn 
 
 o reverend tribun ! o gentl age men ! 
 unbind my son , revers the doom of death , 
 and let me say , that never wept befor , 
 my tear are now prevail orat . 
 luciu . o nobl father , you lament in vain ; 
 the tribun hear you not , no man is by , 
 and you recount your sorrow to a stone . 
 titu . ah , luciu , for thi brother let me plead ! 
 grave tribun , onc more i entreat of you . 
 luciu . my graciou lord , no tribun hear you speak . 
 titu . whi , 't is no matter , man : if they did hear , 
 they would not mark me ; if they did mark , 
 they would not piti me ; yet plead i must , 
 and bootless unto them . 
 therefor i tell my sorrow to the stone ; 
 who though they can not answer my distress , 
 yet in some sort they are better than the tribun , 
 for that they will not intercept my tale . 
 when i do weep , they humbl at my feet 
 receiv my tear , and seem to weep with me ; 
 and were they but attir in grave weed , 
 rome could afford no tribun like to these . 
 a stone is soft as wax : tribun more hard than stone . 
 a stone is silent and offendeth not , 
 and tribun with their tongu doom men to death . 
 [ rise ] 
 but wherefor stand'st thou with thi weapon drawn ? 
 luciu . to rescu my two brother from their death ; 
 for which attempt the judg have pronounc 'd 
 my everlast doom of banish . 
 titu . o happi man ! they have befriend thee . 
 whi , foolish luciu , dost thou not perceiv 
 that rome is but a wilder of tiger ? 
 tiger must prey , and rome afford no prey 
 but me and mine ; how happi art thou then 
 from these devour to be banish ! 
 but who come with our brother marcu here ? 
 
 enter marcu with lavinia 
 
 marcu . titu , prepar thi age eye to weep , 
 or if not so , thi nobl heart to break . 
 i bring consum sorrow to thine age . 
 titu . will it consum me ? let me see it then . 
 marcu . thi wa thi daughter . 
 titu . whi , marcu , so she is . 
 luciu . ay me ! thi object kill me . 
 titu . faint-heart boy , aris , and look upon her . 
 speak , lavinia , what accurs hand 
 hath made thee handless in thi father 's sight ? 
 what fool hath ad water to the sea , 
 or brought a fagot to bright-burn troy ? 
 my grief wa at the height befor thou cam'st , 
 and now like nilu it disdaineth bound . 
 give me a sword , i 'll chop off my hand too , 
 for they have fought for rome , and all in vain ; 
 and they have nur 'd thi woe in feed life ; 
 in bootless prayer have they been held up , 
 and they have serv 'd me to effectless use . 
 now all the servic i requir of them 
 is that the one will help to cut the other . 
 't is well , lavinia , that thou hast no hand ; 
 for hand to do rome servic is but vain . 
 luciu . speak , gentl sister , who hath martyr 'd thee ? 
 marcu . o , that delight engin of her thought 
 that blabb 'd them with such pleas eloqu 
 is torn from forth that pretti hollow cage , 
 where like a sweet melodi bird it sung 
 sweet vari note , enchant everi ear ! 
 luciu . o , say thou for her , who hath done thi deed ? 
 marcu . o , thu i found her stray in the park , 
 seek to hide herself as doth the deer 
 that hath receiv 'd some unrecur wound . 
 titu . it wa my dear , and he that wound her 
 hath hurt me more than had he kill 'd me dead ; 
 for now i stand as one upon a rock , 
 environ 'd with a wilder of sea , 
 who mark the wax tide grow wave by wave , 
 expect ever when some enviou surg 
 will in hi brinish bowel swallow him . 
 thi way to death my wretch son are gone ; 
 here stand my other son , a banish 'd man , 
 and here my brother , weep at my woe . 
 but that which give my soul the greatest spurn 
 is dear lavinia , dearer than my soul . 
 had i but seen thi pictur in thi plight , 
 it would have mad me ; what shall i do 
 now i behold thi live bodi so ? 
 thou hast no hand to wipe away thi tear ,

 shall thi good uncl and thi brother luciu 
 and thou and i sit round about some fountain , 
 look all downward to behold our cheek 
 how they are stain 'd , like meadow yet not dri 
 with miri slime left on them by a flood ? 
 and in the fountain shall we gaze so long , 
 till the fresh tast be taken from that clear , 
 and made a brine-pit with our bitter tear ? 
 or shall we cut away our hand like thine ? 
 or shall we bite our tongu , and in dumb show 
 pass the remaind of our hate day ? 
 what shall we do ? let us that have our tongu 
 plot some devic of further miseri 
 to make us wonder 'd at in time to come .

 and send it to the king : he for the same 
 will send thee hither both thi son aliv , 
 and that shall be the ransom for their fault . 
 titu . o graciou emperor ! o gentl aaron ! 
 did ever raven sing so like a lark 
 that give sweet tide of the sun 's upris ? 
 with all my heart i 'll send the emperor my hand . 
 good aaron , wilt thou help to chop it off ? 
 luciu . stay , father ! for that nobl hand of thine , 
 that hath thrown down so mani enemi , 
 shall not be sent . my hand will serv the turn , 
 my youth can better spare my blood than you , 
 and therefor mine shall save my brother ' live . 
 marcu . which of your hand hath not defend rome 
 and rear 'd aloft the bloodi battle-ax , 
 write destruct on the enemi 's castl ? 
 o , none of both but are of high desert ! 
 my hand hath been but idl ; let it serv 
 to ransom my two nephew from their death ; 
 then have i kept it to a worthi end . 
 aaron . nay , come , agre whose hand shall go along , 
 for fear they die befor their pardon come .

 from thousand danger ; bid him buri it . 
 more hath it merited- that let it have . 
 as for my son , say i account of them 
 as jewel purcha 'd at an easi price ; 
 and yet dear too , becaus i bought mine own .

 doth fat me with the veri thought of it ! 
 let fool do good , and fair men call for grace : 
 aaron will have hi soul black like hi face . exit 
 titu . o , here i lift thi one hand up to heaven , 
 and bow thi feebl ruin to the earth ; 
 if ani power piti wretch tear , 
 to that i call ! [ to lavinia ] what , would'st thou kneel with me ? 
 do , then , dear heart ; for heaven shall hear our prayer , 
 or with our sigh we 'll breath the welkin dim 
 and stain the sun with fog , as sometim cloud 
 when they do hug him in their melt bosom . 
 marcu . o brother , speak with possibl , 
 and do not break into these deep extrem . 
 titu . is not my sorrow deep , have no bottom ? 
 then be my passion bottomless with them . 
 marcu . but yet let reason govern thi lament . 
 titu . if there were reason for these miseri , 
 then into limit could i bind my woe . 
 when heaven doth weep , doth not the earth o'erflow ? 
 if the wind rage , doth not the sea wax mad , 
 threat'n the welkin with hi big-swol'n face ? 
 and wilt thou have a reason for thi coil ? 
 i am the sea ; hark how her sigh do blow . 
 she is the weep welkin , i the earth ; 
 then must my sea be move with her sigh ; 
 then must my earth with her continu tear 
 becom a delug , overflow 'd and drown 'd ; 
 for whi my bowel can not hide her woe , 
 but like a drunkard must i vomit them . 
 then give me leav ; for loser will have leav 
 to eas their stomach with their bitter tongu . 
 
 enter a messeng , with two head and a hand 
 
 messeng . worthi andronicu , ill art thou repaid 
 for that good hand thou sent'st the emperor . 
 here are the head of thi two nobl son ; 
 and here 's thi hand , in scorn to thee sent back-

 that woe is me to think upon thi woe , 
 more than remembr of my father 's death . exit 
 marcu . now let hot aetna cool in sicili , 
 and be my heart an ever-burn hell ! 
 these miseri are more than may be born . 
 to weep with them that weep doth eas some deal , 
 but sorrow flout at is doubl death . 
 luciu . ah , that thi sight should make so deep a wound , 
 and yet detest life not shrink thereat ! 
 that ever death should let life bear hi name , 
 where life hath no more interest but to breath ! 
 [ lavinia kiss titu ] 
 marcu . ala , poor heart , that kiss is comfortless 
 as frozen water to a starv snake . 
 titu . when will thi fear slumber have an end ? 
 marcu . now farewel , flatt'ri ; die , andronicu . 
 thou dost not slumber : see thi two son ' head ,

 struck pale and bloodless ; and thi brother , i ,

 ah ! now no more will i control thi grief . 
 rent off thi silver hair , thi other hand 
 gnaw with thi teeth ; and be thi dismal sight 
 the close up of our most wretch eye . 
 now is a time to storm ; whi art thou still ? 
 titu . ha , ha , ha ! 
 marcu . whi dost thou laugh ? it fit not with thi hour . 
 titu . whi , i have not anoth tear to shed ; 
 besid , thi sorrow is an enemi , 
 and would usurp upon my wat'ri eye 
 and make them blind with tributari tear . 
 then which way shall i find reveng 's cave ? 
 for these two head do seem to speak to me , 
 and threat me i shall never come to bliss 
 till all these mischief be return 'd again 
 even in their throat that have commit them . 
 come , let me see what task i have to do .

 that i may turn me to each one of you 
 and swear unto my soul to right your wrong .

 and in thi hand the other will i bear . 
 and , lavinia , thou shalt be employ 'd in thi ; 
 bear thou my hand , sweet wench , between thi teeth .

 and can not passion our tenfold grief 
 with fold arm . thi poor right hand of mine 
 is left to tyrann upon my breast ; 
 who , when my heart , all mad with miseri , 
 beat in thi hollow prison of my flesh , 
 then thu i thump it down . 
 [ to lavinia ] thou map of woe , that thu dost talk in sign ! 
 when thi poor heart beat with outrag beat , 
 thou canst not strike it thu to make it still . 
 wound it with sigh , girl , kill it with groan ; 
 or get some littl knife between thi teeth 
 and just against thi heart make thou a hole , 
 that all the tear that thi poor eye let fall 
 may run into that sink and , soak in , 
 drown the lament fool in sea-salt tear .

 ah , wherefor dost thou urg the name of hand ? 
 to bid aenea tell the tale twice o'er 
 how troy wa burnt and he made miser ? 
 o , handl not the theme , to talk of hand , 
 lest we rememb still that we have none .

 speechless complain , i will learn thi thought ; 
 in thi dumb action will i be as perfect 
 as beg hermit in their holi prayer . 
 thou shalt not sigh , nor hold thi stump to heaven , 
 nor wink , nor nod , nor kneel , nor make a sign , 
 but i of these will wrest an alphabet ,

 and i have read that hecuba of troy 
 ran mad for sorrow . that made me to fear ; 
 although , my lord , i know my nobl aunt

 and with a gad of steel will write these word , 
 and lay it by . the angri northern wind 
 will blow these sand like sibyl 's leav abroad , 
 and where 's our lesson , then ? boy , what say you ? 
 boy . i say , my lord , that if i were a man

 and substitut in the place of mine , 
 to calm thi tempest whirl in the court ;

 for it is you that put us to our shift . 
 i 'll make you feed on berri and on root ,

 lord of my life , command of my thought , 
 calm thee , and bear the fault of titu ' age , 
 th ' effect of sorrow for hi valiant son 
 whose loss hath pierc 'd him deep and scarr 'd hi heart ;

 these tide nip me , and i hang the head 
 as flower with frost , or grass beat down with storm . 
 ay , now begin our sorrow to approach . 
 't is he the common peopl love so much ; 
 myself hath often heard them say- 
 when i have walk like a privat man- 
 that luciu ' banish wa wrong , 
 and they have wish 'd that luciu were their emperor . 
 tamora . whi should you fear ? is not your citi strong ?

 he can at pleasur stint their melodi ; 
 even so mayest thou the giddi men of rome . 
 then cheer thi spirit ; for know thou , emperor , 
 i will enchant the old andronicu 
 with word more sweet , and yet more danger , 
 than bait to fish or honey-stalk to sheep , 
 when as the one is wound with the bait , 
 the other rot with delici feed .

 act v. scene i . 
 plain near rome 
 
 enter luciu with an armi of goth with drum and colour 
 
 luciu . approv warrior and my faith friend , 
 i have receiv letter from great rome 
 which signifi what hate they bear their emperor 
 and how desir of our sight they are . 
 therefor , great lord , be , as your titl wit , 
 imperi and impati of your wrong ; 
 and wherein rome hath done you ani scath , 
 let him make trebl satisfact . 
 first goth . brave slip , sprung from the great andronicu , 
 whose name wa onc our terror , now our comfort , 
 whose high exploit and honour deed 
 ingrat rome requit with foul contempt , 
 be bold in us : we 'll follow where thou lead'st , 
 like sting bee in hottest summer 's day , 
 led by their master to the flow'r field , 
 and be aveng 'd on curs tamora . 
 all the goth . and as he saith , so say we all with him . 
 luciu . i humbl thank him , and i thank you all . 
 but who come here , led by a lusti goth ? 
 
 enter a goth , lead aaron with hi child in hi arm 
 
 second goth . renown luciu , from our troop i stray 'd 
 to gaze upon a ruinou monasteri ; 
 and as i earnestli did fix mine eye 
 upon the wast build , suddenli 
 i heard a child cri underneath a wall . 
 i made unto the nois , when soon i heard 
 the cri babe control 'd with thi discours : 
 'peac , tawni slave , half me and half thi dam ! 
 did not thi hue bewray whose brat thou art , 
 had natur lent thee but thi mother 's look , 
 villain , thou mightst have been an emperor ; 
 but where the bull and cow are both milk-whit , 
 they never do beget a coal-black calf . 
 peac , villain , peac ! '- even thu he rate the babe- 
 'for i must bear thee to a trusti goth , 
 who , when he know thou art the empress ' babe , 
 will hold thee dearli for thi mother 's sake . ' 
 with thi , my weapon drawn , i rush 'd upon him , 
 surpri 'd him suddenli , and brought him hither 
 to use as you think need of the man . 
 luciu . o worthi goth , thi is the incarn devil 
 that robb 'd andronicu of hi good hand ; 
 thi is the pearl that plea 'd your empress ' eye ; 
 and here 's the base fruit of her burn lust . 
 say , wall-ey 'd slave , whither wouldst thou convey 
 thi grow imag of thi fiend-lik face ? 
 whi dost not speak ? what , deaf ? not a word ? 
 a halter , soldier ! hang him on thi tree , 
 and by hi side hi fruit of bastardi . 
 aaron . touch not the boy , he is of royal blood . 
 luciu . too like the sire for ever be good . 
 first hang the child , that he may see it sprawl- 
 a sight to vex the father 's soul withal . 
 get me a ladder . 
 [ a ladder brought , which aaron is made to climb ] 
 aaron . luciu , save the child , 
 and bear it from me to the emperess . 
 if thou do thi , i 'll show thee wondrou thing 
 that highli may advantag thee to hear ; 
 if thou wilt not , befal what may befal , 
 i 'll speak no more but 'vengeanc rot you all ! ' 
 luciu . say on ; an if it pleas me which thou speak'st , 
 thi child shall live , and i will see it nourish 'd . 
 aaron . an if it pleas thee ! whi , assur thee , luciu , 
 'twill vex thi soul to hear what i shall speak ; 
 for i must talk of murder , rape , and massacr , 
 act of black night , abomin deed , 
 complot of mischief , treason , villaini , 
 ruth to hear , yet piteous perform 'd ; 
 and thi shall all be buri in my death , 
 unless thou swear to me my child shall live . 
 luciu . tell on thi mind ; i say thi child shall live . 
 aaron . swear that he shall , and then i will begin . 
 luciu . who should i swear by ? thou believest no god ; 
 that grant , how canst thou believ an oath ? 
 aaron . what if i do not ? as inde i do not ; 
 yet , for i know thou art religi 
 and hast a thing within thee call conscienc , 
 with twenti popish trick and ceremoni 
 which i have seen thee care to observ , 
 therefor i urg thi oath . for that i know 
 an idiot hold hi baubl for a god , 
 and keep the oath which by that god he swear , 
 to that i 'll urg him . therefor thou shalt vow 
 by that same god- what god soe'er it be 
 that thou adorest and hast in reverence- 
 to save my boy , to nourish and bring him up ; 
 or els i will discov nought to thee . 
 luciu . even by my god i swear to thee i will . 
 aaron . first know thou , i begot him on the empress . 
 luciu . o most insati and luxuri woman ! 
 aaron . tut , luciu , thi wa but a deed of chariti 
 to that which thou shalt hear of me anon . 
 't wa her two son that murder bassianu ; 
 they cut thi sister 's tongu , and ravish 'd her , 
 and cut her hand , and trimm 'd her as thou sawest . 
 luciu . o detest villain ! call'st thou that trim ? 
 aaron . whi , she wa wash 'd , and cut , and trimm 'd , and 't wa 
 trim sport for them which had the do of it . 
 luciu . o barbar beastli villain like thyself ! 
 aaron . inde , i wa their tutor to instruct them . 
 that cod spirit had they from their mother , 
 as sure a card as ever won the set ; 
 that bloodi mind , i think , they learn 'd of me , 
 as true a dog as ever fought at head . 
 well , let my deed be wit of my worth . 
 i train 'd thi brethren to that guil hole 
 where the dead corps of bassianu lay ; 
 i wrote the letter that thi father found , 
 and hid the gold within that letter mention 'd , 
 confeder with the queen and her two son ; 
 and what not done , that thou hast caus to rue , 
 wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it ? 
 i play 'd the cheater for thi father 's hand , 
 and , when i had it , drew myself apart 
 and almost broke my heart with extrem laughter . 
 i pri me through the crevic of a wall , 
 when , for hi hand , he had hi two son ' head ; 
 beheld hi tear , and laugh 'd so heartili 
 that both mine eye were raini like to hi ; 
 and when i told the empress of thi sport , 
 she swoon almost at my pleas tale , 
 and for my tide gave me twenti kiss . 
 goth . what , canst thou say all thi and never blush ? 
 aaron . ay , like a black dog , as the say is . 
 luciu . art thou not sorri for these heinou deed ? 
 aaron . ay , that i had not done a thousand more . 
 even now i curs the day- and yet , i think , 
 few come within the compass of my curse- 
 wherein i did not some notori ill ; 
 as kill a man , or els devis hi death ; 
 ravish a maid , or plot the way to do it ; 
 accus some innoc , and forswear myself ; 
 set deadli enmiti between two friend ; 
 make poor men 's cattl break their neck ; 
 set fire on barn and hay-stack in the night , 
 and bid the owner quench them with their tear . 
 oft have i digg 'd up dead men from their grave , 
 and set them upright at their dear friend ' door 
 even when their sorrow almost wa forgot , 
 and on their skin , as on the bark of tree , 
 have with my knife carv in roman letter 
 'let not your sorrow die , though i am dead . ' 
 tut , i have done a thousand dread thing 
 as willingli as one would kill a fli ; 
 and noth griev me heartili inde 
 but that i can not do ten thousand more . 
 luciu . bring down the devil , for he must not die 
 so sweet a death as hang present . 
 aaron . if there be devil , would i were a devil , 
 to live and burn in everlast fire , 
 so i might have your compani in hell 
 but to torment you with my bitter tongu ! 
 luciu . sir , stop hi mouth , and let him speak no more .

 say that some ladi , as perhap there is , 
 hath for your love as great a pang of heart 
 as you have for olivia . you can not love her ; 
 you tell her so . must she not then be answer 'd ? 
 duke . there is no woman 's side 
 can bide the beat of so strong a passion 
 as love doth give my heart ; no woman 's heart 
 so big to hold so much ; they lack retent . 
 ala , their love may be call 'd appetite- 
 no motion of the liver , but the palate- 
 that suffer surfeit , cloyment , and revolt ; 
 but mine is all as hungri as the sea , 
 and can digest as much . make no compar 
 between that love a woman can bear me 
 and that i owe olivia . 
 viola . ay , but i know- 
 duke . what dost thou know ? 
 viola . too well what love women to men may owe . 
 in faith , they are as true of heart as we . 
 my father had a daughter lov 'd a man , 
 as it might be perhap , were i a woman ,

 but let conceal , like a worm i ' th ' bud , 
 feed on her damask cheek . she pin 'd in thought ; 
 and with a green and yellow melancholi 
 she sat like patienc on a monument , 
 smile at grief . wa not thi love inde ? 
 we men may say more , swear more , but inde 
 our show are more than will ; for still we prove 
 much in our vow , but littl in our love . 
 duke . but die thi sister of her love , my boy ?

 and all the brother too- and yet i know not .

 to the sweet glanc of thi honour 'd love ,

 to see the wonder of the world abroad , 
 than , live dulli sluggardiz 'd at home , 
 wear out thi youth with shapeless idl . 
 but sinc thou lov'st , love still , and thrive therein ,

 for i will be thi headsman , valentin . 
 valentin . and on a love-book pray for my success ? 
 proteu . upon some book i love i 'll pray for thee . 
 valentin . that 's on some shallow stori of deep love : 
 how young leander cross 'd the hellespont . 
 proteu . that 's a deep stori of a deeper love ; 
 for he wa more than over shoe in love . 
 valentin . 't is true ; for you are over boot in love , 
 and yet you never swum the hellespont . 
 proteu . over the boot ! nay , give me not the boot . 
 valentin . no , i will not , for it boot thee not . 
 proteu . what ? 
 valentin . to be in love- where scorn is bought with groan , 
 coy look with heart-sor sigh , one fade moment 's mirth 
 with twenti watch , weari , tediou night ; 
 if hapli won , perhap a hapless gain ; 
 if lost , whi then a grievou labour won ; 
 howev , but a folli bought with wit , 
 or els a wit by folli vanquish . 
 proteu . so , by your circumst , you call me fool . 
 valentin . so , by your circumst , i fear you 'll prove . 
 proteu . 't is love you cavil at ; i am not love . 
 valentin . love is your master , for he master you ; 
 and he that is so yoke by a fool , 
 methink , should not be chronicl for wise . 
 proteu . yet writer say , as in the sweetest bud 
 the eat canker dwell , so eat love 
 inhabit in the finest wit of all . 
 valentin . and writer say , as the most forward bud 
 is eaten by the canker ere it blow , 
 even so by love the young and tender wit 
 is turn 'd to folli , blast in the bud , 
 lose hi verdur even in the prime , 
 and all the fair effect of futur hope . 
 but wherefor wast i time to counsel the

 proteu . my tale of love were wont to weari you ; 
 i know you joy not in a love-discours . 
 valentin . ay , proteu , but that life is alter 'd now ; 
 i have done penanc for contemn love , 
 whose high imperi thought have punish 'd me 
 with bitter fast , with penitenti groan , 
 with nightli tear , and daili heart-sor sigh ; 
 for , in reveng of my contempt of love , 
 love hath cha 'd sleep from my enthral eye 
 and made them watcher of mine own heart 's sorrow . 
 o gentl proteu , love 's a mighti lord , 
 and hath so humbl me as i confess 
 there is no woe to hi correct , 
 nor to hi servic no such joy on earth . 
 now no discours , except it be of love ; 
 now can i break my fast , dine , sup , and sleep , 
 upon the veri nake name of love . 
 proteu . enough ; i read your fortun in your eye . 
 wa thi the idol that you worship so ? 
 valentin . even she ; and is she not a heavenli saint ? 
 proteu . no ; but she is an earthli paragon . 
 valentin . call her divin . 
 proteu . i will not flatter her . 
 valentin . o , flatter me ; for love delight in prais ! 
 proteu . when i wa sick you gave me bitter pill , 
 and i must minist the like to you . 
 valentin . then speak the truth by her ; if not divin , 
 yet let her be a princip , 
 sovereign to all the creatur on the earth . 
 proteu . except my mistress . 
 valentin . sweet , except not ani ; 
 except thou wilt except against my love . 
 proteu . have i not reason to prefer mine own ? 
 valentin . and i will help thee to prefer her too : 
 she shall be dignifi with thi high honour- 
 to bear my ladi 's train , lest the base earth 
 should from her vestur chanc to steal a kiss 
 and , of so great a favour grow proud , 
 disdain to root the summer-swel flow ' r 
 and make rough winter everlastingli . 
 proteu . whi , valentin , what braggard is thi ? 
 valentin . pardon me , proteu ; all i can is noth 
 to her , whose worth make other worthi noth ; 
 she is alon . 
 proteu . then let her alon . 
 valentin . not for the world ! whi , man , she is mine own ; 
 and i as rich in have such a jewel 
 as twenti sea , if all their sand were pearl , 
 the water nectar , and the rock pure gold . 
 forgiv me that i do not dream on thee , 
 becaus thou seest me dote upon my love . 
 my foolish rival , that her father like 
 onli for hi possess are so huge , 
 is gone with her along ; and i must after , 
 for love , thou know'st , is full of jealousi . 
 proteu . but she love you ? 
 valentin . ay , and we are betroth 'd ; nay more , our marriage-hour , 
 with all the cun manner of our flight , 
 determin 'd of- how i must climb her window , 
 the ladder made of cord , and all the mean 
 plot and 'greed on for my happi . 
 good proteu , go with me to my chamber , 
 in these affair to aid me with thi counsel . 
 proteu . go on befor ; i shall enquir you forth ; 
 i must unto the road to disembark 
 some necessari that i need must use ; 
 and then i 'll present attend you . 
 valentin . will you make hast ? 
 proteu . i will . exit valentin 
 even as one heat anoth heat expel 
 or as one nail by strength drive out anoth , 
 so the remembr of my former love 
 is by a newer object quit forgotten . 
 is it my mind , or valentinu ' prais , 
 her true perfect , or my fals transgress , 
 that make me reasonless to reason thu ? 
 she is fair ; and so is julia that i love- 
 that i did love , for now my love is thaw 'd ; 
 which like a waxen imag 'gainst a fire 
 bear no impress of the thing it wa . 
 methink my zeal to valentin is cold , 
 and that i love him not as i wa wont . 
 o ! but i love hi ladi too too much , 
 and that 's the reason i love him so littl . 
 how shall i dote on her with more advic 
 that thu without advic begin to love her ! 
 't is but her pictur i have yet beheld , 
 and that hath dazzl my reason 's light ; 
 but when i look on her perfect , 
 there is no reason but i shall be blind . 
 if i can check my er love , i will ; 
 if not , to compass her i 'll use my skill . exit

 how , with my honour , i may undertak 
 a journey to my love proteu . 
 lucetta . ala , the way is wearisom and long ! 
 julia . a true-devot pilgrim is not weari 
 to measur kingdom with hi feebl step ; 
 much less shall she that hath love 's wing to fli , 
 and when the flight is made to one so dear , 
 of such divin perfect , as sir proteu . 
 lucetta . better forbear till proteu make return . 
 julia . o , know'st thou not hi look are my soul 's food ? 
 piti the dearth that i have pine in 
 by long for that food so long a time . 
 didst thou but know the inli touch of love . 
 thou wouldst as soon go kindl fire with snow 
 as seek to quench the fire of love with word . 
 lucetta . i do not seek to quench your love 's hot fire , 
 but qualifi the fire 's extrem rage , 
 lest it should burn abov the bound of reason . 
 julia . the more thou dam'st it up , the more it burn . 
 the current that with gentl murmur glide ,

 but when hi fair cours is not hinder , 
 he make sweet music with th ' enamel 'd stone , 
 give a gentl kiss to everi sedg 
 he overtaketh in hi pilgrimag ; 
 and so by mani wind nook he stray , 
 with will sport , to the wild ocean . 
 then let me go , and hinder not my cours . 
 i 'll be as patient as a gentl stream , 
 and make a pastim of each weari step , 
 till the last step have brought me to my love ; 
 and there i 'll rest as , after much turmoil , 
 a bless soul doth in elysium . 
 lucetta . but in what habit will you go along ? 
 julia . not like a woman , for i would prevent 
 the loos encount of lascivi men ;

 but tell me , wench , how will the world reput me 
 for undertak so unstaid a journey ? 
 i fear me it will make me scandaliz 'd . 
 lucetta . if you think so , then stay at home and go not .

 if proteu like your journey when you come , 
 no matter who 's displea 'd when you are gone . 
 i fear me he will scarc be plea 'd withal . 
 julia . that is the least , lucetta , of my fear : 
 a thousand oath , an ocean of hi tear , 
 and instanc of infinit of love , 
 warrant me welcom to my proteu . 
 lucetta . all these are servant to deceit men . 
 julia . base men that use them to so base effect ! 
 but truer star did govern proteu ' birth ; 
 hi word are bond , hi oath are oracl , 
 hi love sincer , hi thought immacul ,

 hi heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth . 
 lucetta . pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him . 
 julia . now , as thou lov'st me , do him not that wrong 
 to bear a hard opinion of hi truth ; 
 onli deserv my love by love him . 
 and present go with me to my chamber ,

 the law of friendship bid me to conceal ; 
 but , when i call to mind your graciou favour 
 done to me , undeserv as i am , 
 my duti prick me on to utter that 
 which els no worldli good should draw from me . 
 know , worthi princ , sir valentin , my friend , 
 thi night intend to steal away your daughter ; 
 myself am one made privi to the plot . 
 i know you have determin 'd to bestow her 
 on thurio , whom your gentl daughter hate ; 
 and should she thu be stol'n away from you , 
 it would be much vexat to your age . 
 thu , for my duti 's sake , i rather chose 
 to cross my friend in hi intend drift 
 than , by conceal it , heap on your head 
 a pack of sorrow which would press you down , 
 be unprev , to your timeless grave . 
 duke . proteu , i thank thee for thine honest care , 
 which to requit , command me while i live . 
 thi love of their myself have often seen , 
 hapli when they have judg 'd me fast asleep , 
 and oftentim have purpo 'd to forbid 
 sir valentin her compani and my court ; 
 but , fear lest my jealou aim might err 
 and so , unworthili , disgrac the man , 
 a rash that i ever yet have shunn 'd , 
 i gave him gentl look , therebi to find 
 that which thyself hast now disclo 'd to me . 
 and , that thou mayst perceiv my fear of thi , 
 know that tender youth is soon suggest , 
 i nightli lodg her in an upper tow ' r , 
 the key whereof myself have ever kept ; 
 and thenc she can not be convey 'd away . 
 proteu . know , nobl lord , they have devi 'd a mean 
 how he her chamber window will ascend 
 and with a cord ladder fetch her down ; 
 for which the youth lover now is gone , 
 and thi way come he with it present ; 
 where , if it pleas you , you may intercept him . 
 but , good my lord , do it so cunningli 
 that my discoveri be not aim at ; 
 for love of you , not hate unto my friend , 
 hath made me publish of thi pretenc .

 duke . sir valentin , whither away so fast ? 
 valentin . pleas it your grace , there is a messeng 
 that stay to bear my letter to my friend , 
 and i am go to deliv them . 
 duke . be they of much import ? 
 valentin . the tenour of them doth but signifi 
 my health and happi be at your court . 
 duke . nay then , no matter ; stay with me awhil ; 
 i am to break with thee of some affair 
 that touch me near , wherein thou must be secret . 
 't is not unknown to thee that i have sought 
 to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter . 
 valentin . i know it well , my lord ; and , sure , the match 
 were rich and honour ; besid , the gentleman 
 is full of virtu , bounti , worth , and qualiti 
 beseem such a wife as your fair daughter . 
 can not your grace win her to fanci him ? 
 duke . no , trust me ; she is peevish , sullen , froward , 
 proud , disobedi , stubborn , lack duti ; 
 neither regard that she is my child 
 nor fear me as if i were her father ; 
 and , may i say to thee , thi pride of her , 
 upon advic , hath drawn my love from her ; 
 and , where i thought the remnant of mine age 
 should have been cherish 'd by her childlik duti , 
 i now am full resolv 'd to take a wife 
 and turn her out to who will take her in . 
 then let her beauti be her wedding-dow ' r ; 
 for me and my possess she esteem not . 
 valentin . what would your grace have me to do in thi ? 
 duke . there is a ladi , in verona here , 
 whom i affect ; but she is nice , and coy , 
 and nought esteem my age eloqu . 
 now , therefor , would i have thee to my tutor- 
 for long agon i have forgot to court ; 
 besid , the fashion of the time is chang'd- 
 how and which way i may bestow myself 
 to be regard in her sun-bright eye . 
 valentin . win her with gift , if she respect not word : 
 dumb jewel often in their silent kind 
 more than quick word do move a woman 's mind . 
 duke . but she did scorn a present that i sent her . 
 valentin . a woman sometim scorn what best content her . 
 send her anoth ; never give her o'er , 
 for scorn at first make after-lov the more . 
 if she do frown , 't is not in hate of you , 
 but rather to beget more love in you ; 
 if she do chide , 't is not to have you gone , 
 for whi , the fool are mad if left alon . 
 take no repuls , whatev she doth say ; 
 for 'get you gone ' she doth not mean 'away ! ' 
 flatter and prais , commend , extol their grace ; 
 though ne'er so black , say they have angel ' face . 
 that man that hath a tongu , i say , is no man , 
 if with hi tongu he can not win a woman . 
 duke . but she i mean is promi 'd by her friend 
 unto a youth gentleman of worth ; 
 and kept sever from resort of men , 
 that no man hath access by day to her . 
 valentin . whi then i would resort to her by night . 
 duke . ay , but the door be lock 'd and key kept safe , 
 that no man hath recours to her by night . 
 valentin . what let but one may enter at her window ? 
 duke . her chamber is aloft , far from the ground , 
 and built so shelv that one can not climb it 
 without appar hazard of hi life . 
 valentin . whi then a ladder , quaintli made of cord , 
 to cast up with a pair of anchor hook , 
 would serv to scale anoth hero 's tow ' r , 
 so bold leander would adventur it . 
 duke . now , as thou art a gentleman of blood , 
 advis me where i may have such a ladder . 
 valentin . when would you use it ? pray , sir , tell me that . 
 duke . thi veri night ; for love is like a child , 
 that long for everyth that he can come by . 
 valentin . by seven o'clock i 'll get you such a ladder . 
 duke . but , hark thee ; i will go to her alon ; 
 how shall i best convey the ladder thither ? 
 valentin . it will be light , my lord , that you may bear it 
 under a cloak that is of ani length . 
 duke . a cloak as long as thine will serv the turn ? 
 valentin . ay , my good lord . 
 duke . then let me see thi cloak . 
 i 'll get me one of such anoth length . 
 valentin . whi , ani cloak will serv the turn , my lord . 
 duke . how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak ? 
 i pray thee , let me feel thi cloak upon me . 
 what letter is thi same ? what 's here ? 'to silvia ' ! 
 and here an engin fit for my proceed ! 
 i 'll be so bold to break the seal for onc . [ read ]

 thank me for thi more than for all the favour 
 which , all too much , i have bestow 'd on thee . 
 but if thou linger in my territori 
 longer than swiftest expedit 
 will give thee time to leav our royal court , 
 by heaven ! my wrath shall far exceed the love 
 i ever bore my daughter or thyself . 
 be gone ; i will not hear thi vain excus , 
 but , as thou lov'st thi life , make speed from henc . exit 
 valentin . and whi not death rather than live torment ? 
 to die is to be banish 'd from myself , 
 and silvia is myself ; banish 'd from her 
 is self from self , a deadli banish . 
 what light is light , if silvia be not seen ? 
 what joy is joy , if silvia be not by ? 
 unless it be to think that she is by , 
 and feed upon the shadow of perfect . 
 except i be by silvia in the night , 
 there is no music in the nightingal ; 
 unless i look on silvia in the day , 
 there is no day for me to look upon . 
 she is my essenc , and i leav to be

 trench in ice , which with an hour 's heat 
 dissolv to water and doth lose hi form . 
 a littl time will melt her frozen thought , 
 and worthless valentin shall be forgot . 
 
 enter proteu 
 
 how now , sir proteu ! is your countryman , 
 accord to our proclam , gone ? 
 proteu . gone , my good lord . 
 duke . my daughter take hi go grievous . 
 proteu . a littl time , my lord , will kill that grief . 
 duke . so i believ ; but thurio think not so . 
 proteu , the good conceit i hold of thee- 
 for thou hast shown some sign of good desert- 
 make me the better to confer with thee . 
 proteu . longer than i prove loyal to your grace 
 let me not live to look upon your grace . 
 duke . thou know'st how willingli i would effect 
 the match between sir thurio and my daughter . 
 proteu . i do , my lord . 
 duke . and also , i think , thou art not ignor 
 how she oppos her against my will . 
 proteu . she did , my lord , when valentin wa here . 
 duke . ay , and pervers she persev so . 
 what might we do to make the girl forget 
 the love of valentin , and love sir thurio ? 
 proteu . the best way is to slander valentin 
 with falsehood , cowardic , and poor descent- 
 three thing that women highli hold in hate . 
 duke . ay , but she 'll think that it is spoke in hate . 
 proteu . ay , if hi enemi deliv it ; 
 therefor it must with circumst be spoken 
 by one whom she esteemeth as hi friend . 
 duke . then you must undertak to slander him . 
 proteu . and that , my lord , i shall be loath to do : 
 't is an ill offic for a gentleman , 
 especi against hi veri friend . 
 duke . where your good word can not advantag him , 
 your slander never can endamag him ; 
 therefor the offic is indiffer , 
 be entreat to it by your friend . 
 proteu . you have prevail 'd , my lord ; if i can do it 
 by aught that i can speak in hi disprais , 
 she shall not long continu love to him . 
 but say thi weed her love from valentin , 
 it follow not that she will love sir thurio . 
 thurio . therefor , as you unwind her love from him , 
 lest it should ravel and be good to none , 
 you must provid to bottom it on me ; 
 which must be done by prais me as much 
 as you in worth disprais sir valentin . 
 duke . and , proteu , we dare trust you in thi kind , 
 becaus we know , on valentin 's report , 
 you are alreadi love 's firm votari 
 and can not soon revolt and chang your mind . 
 upon thi warrant shall you have access 
 where you with silvia may confer at large- 
 for she is lumpish , heavi , melancholi , 
 and , for your friend 's sake , will be glad of you- 
 where you may temper her by your persuas 
 to hate young valentin and love my friend . 
 proteu . as much as i can do i will effect . 
 but you , sir thurio , are not sharp enough ; 
 you must lay lime to tangl her desir 
 by wail sonnet , whose compos rhyme 
 should be full-fraught with servic vow . 
 duke . ay , 
 much is the forc of heaven-br poesi . 
 proteu . say that upon the altar of her beauti 
 you sacrific your tear , your sigh , your heart ; 
 write till your ink be dri , and with your tear 
 moist it again , and frame some feel line 
 that may discov such integr ; 
 for orpheu ' lute wa strung with poet ' sinew , 
 whose golden touch could soften steel and stone , 
 make tiger tame , and huge leviathan 
 forsak unsound deep to danc on sand . 
 after your dire-la elegi , 
 visit by night your ladi 's chamber window 
 with some sweet consort ; to their instrument 
 tune a deplor dump- the night 's dead silenc 
 will well becom such sweet-complain grievanc . 
 thi , or els noth , will inherit her . 
 duke . thi disciplin show thou hast been in love . 
 thurio . and thi advic thi night i 'll put in practic ; 
 therefor , sweet proteu , my direction-giv , 
 let us into the citi present 
 to sort some gentlemen well skill 'd in music . 
 i have a sonnet that will serv the turn 
 to give the onset to thi good advic . 
 duke . about it , gentlemen ! 
 proteu . we 'll wait upon your grace till after supper , 
 and afterward determin our proceed . 
 duke . even now about it ! i will pardon you . exeunt

 poor gentlewoman , my master wrong her much .

 that i have wept a hundr sever time . 
 silvia . belik she think that proteu hath forsook her . 
 julia . i think she doth , and that 's her caus of sorrow . 
 silvia . is she not pass fair ? 
 julia . she hath been fairer , madam , than she is . 
 when she did think my master lov 'd her well , 
 she , in my judgment , wa as fair as you ; 
 but sinc she did neglect her looking-glass 
 and threw her sun-expel mask away , 
 the air hath starv 'd the rose in her cheek 
 and pinch 'd the lily-tinctur of her face , 
 that now she is becom as black as i . 
 silvia . how tall wa she ? 
 julia . about my statur ; for at pentecost , 
 when all our pageant of delight were play 'd , 
 our youth got me to play the woman 's part , 
 and i wa trimm 'd in madam julia 's gown ; 
 which serv me as fit , by all men 's judgment , 
 as if the garment had been made for me ; 
 therefor i know she is about my height . 
 and at that time i made her weep a good , 
 for i did play a lament part . 
 madam , 't wa ariadn passion 
 for theseu ' perjuri and unjust flight ; 
 which i so live act with my tear 
 that my poor mistress , move therewith , 
 wept bitterli ; and would i might be dead 
 if i in thought felt not her veri sorrow . 
 silvia . she is behold to thee , gentl youth . 
 ala , poor ladi , desol and left ! 
 i weep myself , to think upon thi word . 
 here , youth , there is my purs ; i give thee thi 
 for thi sweet mistress ' sake , becaus thou lov'st her . 
 farewel . exit silvia with attend 
 julia . and she shall thank you for't , if e'er you know her . 
 a virtuou gentlewoman , mild and beauti ! 
 i hope my master 's suit will be but cold , 
 sinc she respect my mistress ' love so much . 
 ala , how love can trifl with itself ! 
 here is her pictur ; let me see . i think , 
 if i had such a tire , thi face of mine 
 were full as love as is thi of her ; 
 and yet the painter flatter 'd her a littl , 
 unless i flatter with myself too much . 
 her hair is auburn , mine is perfect yellow ; 
 if that be all the differ in hi love , 
 i 'll get me such a colour 'd periwig . 
 her eye are grey as glass , and so are mine ; 
 ay , but her forehead 's low , and mine 's as high .

 tune my distress and record my woe . 
 o thou that dost inhabit in my breast , 
 leav not the mansion so long tenantless , 
 lest , grow ruinou , the build fall 
 and leav no memori of what it wa ! 
 repair me with thi presenc , silvia : 
 thou gentl nymph , cherish thi forlorn swain . 
 what hallo and what stir is thi to-day ? 
 these are my mate , that make their will their law , 
 have some unhappi passeng in chase .

 though you respect not aught your servant doth , 
 to hazard life , and rescu you from him 
 that would have forc 'd your honour and your love . 
 vouchsaf me , for my meed , but one fair look ; 
 a smaller boon than thi i can not beg , 
 and less than thi , i am sure , you can not give . 
 valentin . [ asid ] how like a dream is thi i see and hear ! 
 love , lend me patienc to forbear awhil . 
 silvia . o miser , unhappi that i am ! 
 proteu . unhappi were you , madam , ere i came ; 
 but by my come i have made you happi . 
 silvia . by thi approach thou mak'st me most unhappi . 
 julia . [ asid ] and me , when he approacheth to your presenc . 
 silvia . had i been seiz by a hungri lion , 
 i would have been a breakfast to the beast 
 rather than have fals proteu rescu me . 
 o , heaven be judg how i love valentin , 
 whose life 's as tender to me as my soul ! 
 and full as much , for more there can not be , 
 i do detest fals , perjur 'd proteu . 
 therefor be gone ; solicit me no more . 
 proteu . what danger action , stood it next to death , 
 would i not undergo for one calm look ? 
 o , 't is the curs in love , and still approv 'd , 
 when women can not love where they 're belov 'd ! 
 silvia . when proteu can not love where he 's belov 'd ! 
 read over julia 's heart , thi first best love , 
 for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thi faith 
 into a thousand oath ; and all those oath 
 descend into perjuri , to love me . 
 thou hast no faith left now , unless thou'dst two , 
 and that 's far wors than none ; better have none 
 than plural faith , which is too much by one . 
 thou counterfeit to thi true friend ! 
 proteu . in love , 
 who respect friend ? 
 silvia . all men but proteu . 
 proteu . nay , if the gentl spirit of move word 
 can no way chang you to a milder form , 
 i 'll woo you like a soldier , at arm ' end , 
 and love you 'gainst the natur of love- forc ye . 
 silvia . o heaven ! 
 proteu . i 'll forc thee yield to my desir . 
 valentin . ruffian ! let go that rude uncivil touch ; 
 thou friend of an ill fashion ! 
 proteu . valentin ! 
 valentin . thou common friend , that 's without faith or love- 
 for such is a friend now ; treacher man , 
 thou hast beguil 'd my hope ; nought but mine eye 
 could have persuad me . now i dare not say 
 i have one friend aliv : thou wouldst disprov me . 
 who should be trust , when one 's own right hand 
 is perjur to the bosom ? proteu , 
 i am sorri i must never trust thee more , 
 but count the world a stranger for thi sake . 
 the privat wound is deepest . o time most accurst ! 
 'mongst all foe that a friend should be the worst ! 
 proteu . my shame and guilt confound me . 
 forgiv me , valentin ; if hearti sorrow 
 be a suffici ransom for offenc , 
 i tender 't here ; i do as truli suffer 
 as e'er i did commit . 
 valentin . then i am paid ; 
 and onc again i do receiv thee honest . 
 who by repent is not satisfi 
 is nor of heaven nor earth , for these are plea 'd ; 
 by penit th ' etern 's wrath 's appea 'd . 
 and , that my love may appear plain and free , 
 all that wa mine in silvia i give thee . 
 julia . o me unhappi ! [ swoon ]

 silvia , which , out of my neglect , wa never done . 
 proteu . where is that ring , boy ? 
 julia . here 't is ; thi is it . 
 proteu . how ! let me see . whi , thi is the ring i gave to julia . 
 julia . o , cri you merci , sir , i have mistook ;

 proteu . but how cam'st thou by thi ring ? 
 at my depart i gave thi unto julia . 
 julia . and julia herself did give it me ; 
 and julia herself have brought it hither . 
 proteu . how ! julia ! 
 julia . behold her that gave aim to all thi oath , 
 and entertain 'd 'em deepli in her heart . 
 how oft hast thou with perjuri cleft the root ! 
 o proteu , let thi habit make thee blush ! 
 be thou asham 'd that i have took upon me 
 such an immodest raiment- if shame live 
 in a disguis of love . 
 it is the lesser blot , modesti find , 
 women to chang their shape than men their mind . 
 proteu . than men their mind ! 't is true . o heaven , were man 
 but constant , he were perfect ! that one error 
 fill him with fault ; make him run through all th ' sin : 
 inconst fall off ere it begin . 
 what is in silvia 's face but i may spi 
 more fresh in julia 's with a constant eye ? 
 valentin . come , come , a hand from either . 
 let me be blest to make thi happi close ; 
 'twere piti two such friend should be long foe . 
 proteu . bear wit , heaven , i have my wish for ever .

 thurio . sir valentin , i care not for her , i ; 
 i hold him but a fool that will endang 
 hi bodi for a girl that love him not . 
 i claim her not , and therefor she is thine . 
 duke . the more degener and base art thou 
 to make such mean for her as thou hast done 
 and leav her on such slight condit . 
 now , by the honour of my ancestri , 
 i do applaud thi spirit , valentin , 
 and think thee worthi of an empress ' love .

 cancel all grudg , repeal thee home again , 
 plead a new state in thi unrival 'd merit , 
 to which i thu subscrib : sir valentin ,

 take thou thi silvia , for thou hast deserv 'd her . 
 valentin . i thank your grace ; the gift hath made me happi . 
 i now beseech you , for your daughter 's sake , 
 to grant one boon that i shall ask of you . 
 duke . i grant it for thine own , whate' it be . 
 valentin . these banish 'd men , that i have kept withal , 
 are men endu 'd with worthi qualiti ; 
 forgiv them what they have commit here , 
 and let them be recal 'd from their exil : 
 they are reform , civil , full of good , 
 and fit for great employ , worthi lord . 
 duke . thou hast prevail 'd ; i pardon them , and thee ; 
 dispos of them as thou know'st their desert . 
 come , let us go ; we will includ all jar 
 with triumph , mirth , and rare solemn .

 with our discours to make your grace to smile .

 valentin . i warrant you , my lord- more grace than boy . 
 duke . what mean you by that say ? 
 valentin . pleas you , i 'll tell you as we pass along , 
 that you will wonder what hath fortun . 
 come , proteu , 't is your penanc but to hear 
 the stori of your love discov . 
 that done , our day of marriag shall be your ;

 archidamu . believ me , i speak as my understand instruct me 
 and as mine honesti put it to utter . 
 camillo . sicilia can not show himself overkind to bohemia . they were

 separ of their societi , their encount , though not

 were from the end of oppos wind . the heaven continu their 
 love ! 
 archidamu . i think there is not in the world either malic or 
 matter to alter it . you have an unspeak comfort of your young 
 princ mamilliu ; it is a gentleman of the greatest promis that 
 ever came into my note . 
 camillo . i veri well agre with you in the hope of him . it is a 
 gallant child ; one that inde physic the subject , make old 
 heart fresh ; they that went on crutch ere he wa born desir 
 yet their life to see him a man . 
 archidamu . would they els be content to die ? 
 camillo . ye ; if there were no other excus whi they should desir 
 to live .

 crutch till he had one .

 polixen . nine chang of the wat'ri star hath been 
 the shepherd 's note sinc we have left our throne 
 without a burden . time as long again 
 would be fill 'd up , my brother , with our thank ; 
 and yet we should for perpetu 
 go henc in debt . and therefor , like a cipher , 
 yet stand in rich place , i multipli 
 with one 'we thank you ' mani thousand moe 
 that go befor it . 
 leont . stay your thank a while , 
 and pay them when you part . 
 polixen . sir , that 's to-morrow . 
 i am question 'd by my fear of what may chanc

 leont . we 'll part the time between 's then ; and in that 
 i 'll no gainsay . 
 polixen . press me not , beseech you , so . 
 there is no tongu that move , none , none i ' th ' world , 
 so soon as your could win me . so it should now , 
 were there necess in your request , although 
 'twere need i deni it . my affair 
 do even drag me homeward ; which to hinder 
 were in your love a whip to me ; my stay 
 to you a charg and troubl . to save both , 
 farewel , our brother . 
 leont . tongue-ti , our queen ? speak you . 
 hermion . i had thought , sir , to have held my peac until 
 you had drawn oath from him not to stay . you , sir , 
 charg him too coldli . tell him you are sure 
 all in bohemia 's well- thi satisfact 
 the by-gon day proclaim 'd . say thi to him , 
 he 's beat from hi best ward . 
 leont . well said , hermion . 
 hermion . to tell he long to see hi son were strong ; 
 but let him say so then , and let him go ; 
 but let him swear so , and he shall not stay ; 
 we 'll thwack him henc with distaff . 
 [ to polixen ] yet of your royal presenc i 'll

 not like a guest ; so you shall pay your fee 
 when you depart , and save your thank . how say you ? 
 my prison or my guest ? by your dread 'verili , ' 
 one of them you shall be . 
 polixen . your guest , then , madam : 
 to be your prison should import offend ; 
 which is for me less easi to commit 
 than you to punish . 
 hermion . not your gaoler then , 
 but your kind . hostess . come , i 'll question you 
 of my lord 's trick and your when you were boy . 
 you were pretti lord then ! 
 polixen . we were , fair queen , 
 two lad that thought there wa no more behind 
 but such a day to-morrow as to-day , 
 and to be boy etern . 
 hermion . wa not my lord 
 the verier wag o ' th ' two ? 
 polixen . we were as twinn 'd lamb that did frisk i ' th ' sun 
 and bleat the one at th ' other . what we chang 'd 
 wa innoc for innoc ; we knew not 
 the doctrin of ill-do , nor dream 'd 
 that ani did . had we pursu 'd that life , 
 and our weak spirit ne'er been higher rear 'd 
 with stronger blood , we should have answer 'd heaven 
 boldli 'not guilti , ' the imposit clear 'd 
 hereditari our . 
 hermion . by thi we gather

 of thi make no conclus , lest you say 
 your queen and i are devil . yet , go on ; 
 th ' offenc we have made you do we 'll answer , 
 if you first sinn 'd with us , and that with us 
 you did continu fault , and that you slipp 'd not 
 with ani but with us . 
 leont . is he won yet ? 
 hermion . he 'll stay , my lord . 
 leont . at my request he would not . 
 hermion , my dearest , thou never spok'st 
 to better purpos . 
 hermion . never ? 
 leont . never but onc . 
 hermion . what ! have i twice said well ? when was't befor ? 
 i prithe tell me ; cram 's with prais , and make 's 
 as fat as tame thing . one good deed die tongueless 
 slaughter a thousand wait upon that . 
 our prais are our wage ; you may ride 's 
 with one soft kiss a thousand furlong ere 
 with spur we heat an acr . but to th ' goal : 
 my last good deed wa to entreat hi stay ; 
 what wa my first ? it ha an elder sister , 
 or i mistak you . o , would her name were grace ! 
 but onc befor i spoke to th ' purpose- when ? 
 nay , let me have't ; i long . 
 leont . whi , that wa when 
 three crab month had sour 'd themselv to death , 
 ere i could make thee open thi white hand 
 and clap thyself my love ; then didst thou utter 
 ' i am your for ever . ' 
 hermion . 't is grace inde . 
 whi , lo you now , i have spoke to th ' purpos twice : 
 the one for ever earn 'd a royal husband ; 
 th ' other for some while a friend . 
 [ give her hand to polixen ] 
 leont . [ asid ] too hot , too hot ! 
 to mingl friendship far is mingl blood . 
 i have tremor cordi on me ; my heart danc , 
 but not for joy , not joy . thi entertain 
 may a free face put on ; deriv a liberti 
 from hearti , from bounti , fertil bosom , 
 and well becom the agent . 't may , i grant ; 
 but to be paddl palm and pinch finger , 
 as now they are , and make practi 'd smile 
 as in a looking-glass ; and then to sigh , as 'twere 
 the mort o ' th ' deer . o , that is entertain 
 my bosom like not , nor my brow ! mamilliu ,

 upon hi palm ? - how now , you wanton calf , 
 art thou my calf ? 
 mamilliu . ye , if you will , my lord . 
 leont . thou want'st a rough pash and the shoot that i have , 
 to be full like me ; yet they say we are 
 almost as like as egg . women say so , 
 that will say anyth . but were they fals 
 as o'er-di 'd black , as wind , as waters- fals 
 as dice are to be wish 'd by one that fix 
 no bourn 'twixt hi and mine ; yet were it true 
 to say thi boy were like me . come , sir page , 
 look on me with your welkin eye . sweet villain ! 
 most dear'st ! my collop ! can thi dam ? - may't be ? 
 affect ! thi intent stab the centr . 
 thou dost make possibl thing not so held , 
 communicat'st with dreams- how can thi be ? - 
 with what 's unreal thou coactiv art , 
 and fellow'st noth . then 't is veri credent 
 thou mayst co-join with someth ; and thou dost- 
 and that beyond commiss ; and i find it , 
 and that to the infect of my brain 
 and hard'n of my brow .

 what cheer ? how is't with you , best brother ? 
 hermion . you look

 are you mov 'd , my lord ? 
 leont . no , in good earnest . 
 how sometim natur will betray it folli , 
 it tender , and make itself a pastim 
 to harder bosom ! look on the line 
 of my boy 's face , methought i did recoil 
 twenty-thre year ; and saw myself unbreech 'd , 
 in my green velvet coat ; my dagger muzzl 'd , 
 lest it should bite it master and so prove , 
 as ornament oft do , too danger . 
 how like , methought , i then wa to thi kernel ,

 will you take egg for money ? 
 mamilliu . no , my lord , i 'll fight . 
 leont . you will ? whi , happi man be 's dole ! my brother ,

 and with hi vari child cure in me 
 thought that would thick my blood .

 offic 'd with me . we two will walk , my lord , 
 and leav you to your graver step . hermion , 
 how thou lov'st us show in our brother 's welcom ; 
 let what is dear in sicili be cheap ;

 sometim put forth . in your affair , my lord , 
 if ever i were wilfull-neglig ,

 about hi neck , bohemia ; who- if i 
 had servant true about me that bare eye 
 to see alik mine honour as their profit , 
 their own particular thrift , they would do that 
 which should undo more do . ay , and thou , 
 hi cupbearer- whom i from meaner form 
 have bench 'd and rear 'd to worship ; who mayst see , 
 plainli as heaven see earth and earth see heaven , 
 how i am gall'd- mightst bespic a cup 
 to give mine enemi a last wink ; 
 which draught to me were cordial . 
 camillo . sir , my lord , 
 i could do thi ; and that with no rash potion , 
 but with a ling'r dram that should not work 
 malici like poison . but i can not 
 believ thi crack to be in my dread mistress , 
 so sovereignli be honour . 
 i have lov 'd thee- 
 leont . make that thi question , and go rot ! 
 dost think i am so muddi , so unsettl , 
 to appoint myself in thi vexat ; sulli 
 the puriti and white of my sheets- 
 which to preserv is sleep , which be spot 
 is goad , thorn , nettl , tail of wasp ; 
 give scandal to the blood o ' th ' princ , my son- 
 who i do think is mine , and love as mine- 
 without ripe move to 't ? would i do thi ? 
 could man so blench ? 
 camillo . i must believ you , sir . 
 i do ; and will fetch off bohemia for't ; 
 provid that , when he 's remov 'd , your high 
 will take again your queen as your at first , 
 even for your son 's sake ; and therebi for seal 
 the injuri of tongu in court and kingdom 
 known and alli to your .

 even so as i mine own cours have set down . 
 i 'll give no blemish to her honour , none .

 as friendship wear at feast , keep with bohemia 
 and with your queen . i am hi cupbear ; 
 if from me he have wholesom beverag , 
 account me not your servant . 
 leont . thi is all : 
 do't , and thou hast the one half of my heart ; 
 do't not , thou split'st thine own . 
 camillo . i 'll do't , my lord . 
 leont . i will seem friendli , as thou hast advi 'd me . exit 
 camillo . o miser ladi ! but , for me , 
 what case stand i in ? i must be the poison 
 of good polixen ; and my ground to do't 
 is the obedi to a master ; one 
 who , in rebellion with himself , will have 
 all that are hi so too . to do thi deed , 
 promot follow . if i could find exampl 
 of thousand that had struck anoint king 
 and flourish 'd after , i 'd not do't ; but sinc 
 nor brass , nor stone , nor parchment , bear not one , 
 let villaini itself forswear't . i must 
 forsak the court . to do't , or no , is certain 
 to me a break-neck . happi star reign now !

 good day , camillo . 
 camillo . hail , most royal sir ! 
 polixen . what is the news i ' th ' court ? 
 camillo . none rare , my lord . 
 polixen . the king hath on him such a counten 
 as he had lost some provinc , and a region 
 lov 'd as he love himself ; even now i met him 
 with customari compliment , when he , 
 waft hi eye to th ' contrari and fall 
 a lip of much contempt , speed from me ; 
 so leav me to consid what is breed 
 that chang thu hi manner . 
 camillo . i dare not know , my lord . 
 polixen . how , dare not ! do not . do you know , and dare not 
 be intellig to me ? 't is thereabout ; 
 for , to yourself , what you do know , you must , 
 and can not say you dare not . good camillo , 
 your chang 'd complexion are to me a mirror 
 which show me mine chang 'd too ; for i must be 
 a parti in thi alter , find 
 myself thu alter 'd with't . 
 camillo . there is a sick 
 which put some of us in distemp ; but 
 i can not name the diseas ; and it is caught 
 of you that yet are well . 
 polixen . how ! caught of me ? 
 make me not sight like the basilisk ; 
 i have look 'd on thousand who have sped the better 
 by my regard , but kill 'd none so . camillo- 
 as you are certainli a gentleman ; thereto 
 clerk-lik experienc 'd , which no less adorn 
 our gentri than our parent ' nobl name , 
 in whose success we are gentle- i beseech you , 
 if you know aught which doe behov my knowledg 
 thereof to be inform 'd , impriso n't not 
 in ignor conceal . 
 camillo . i may not answer . 
 polixen . a sick caught of me , and yet i well ? 
 i must be answer 'd . dost thou hear , camillo ? 
 i conjur thee , by all the part of man 
 which honour doe acknowledg , whereof the least 
 is not thi suit of mine , that thou declar 
 what incid thou dost guess of harm 
 is creep toward me ; how far off , how near ; 
 which way to be prevent , if to be ; 
 if not , how best to bear it . 
 camillo . sir , i will tell you ; 
 sinc i am charg 'd in honour , and by him 
 that i think honour . therefor mark my counsel , 
 which must be ev'n as swiftli follow as 
 i mean to utter it , or both yourself and me 
 cri lost , and so goodnight . 
 polixen . on , good camillo . 
 camillo . i am appoint him to murder you . 
 polixen . by whom , camillo ? 
 camillo . by the king . 
 polixen . for what ? 
 camillo . he think , nay , with all confid he swear , 
 as he had seen 't or been an instrument 
 to vice you to't , that you have touch 'd hi queen 
 forbiddenli . 
 polixen . o , then my best blood turn 
 to an infect jelli , and my name 
 be yok 'd with hi that did betray the best ! 
 turn then my freshest reput to 
 a savour that may strike the dullest nostril 
 where i arriv , and my approach be shunn 'd , 
 nay , hate too , wors than the great'st infect 
 that e'er wa heard or read ! 
 camillo . swear hi thought over 
 by each particular star in heaven and 
 by all their influenc , you may as well 
 forbid the sea for to obey the moon 
 as or by oath remov or counsel shake 
 the fabric of hi folli , whose foundat 
 is pil 'd upon hi faith and will continu 
 the stand of hi bodi . 
 polixen . how should thi grow ? 
 camillo . i know not ; but i am sure 't is safer to 
 avoid what 's grown than question how 't is born . 
 if therefor you dare trust my honesti , 
 that lie enclos in thi trunk which you 
 shall bear along impawn 'd , away to-night . 
 your follow i will whisper to the busi ;

 by thi discoveri lost . be not uncertain , 
 for , by the honour of my parent , i 
 have utt'r truth ; which if you seek to prove , 
 i dare not stand by ; nor shall you be safer 
 than one condemn 'd by the king 's own mouth , thereon 
 hi execut sworn . 
 polixen . i do believ thee : 
 i saw hi heart in 's face . give me thi hand ; 
 be pilot to me , and thi place shall

 must it be violent ; and as he doe conceiv 
 he is dishonour 'd by a man which ever

 in that be made more bitter . fear o'ershad me . 
 good expedit be my friend , and comfort

 is quit beyond mine arm , out of the blank 
 and level of my brain , plot-proof ; but she 
 i can hook to me- say that she were gone , 
 given to the fire , a moieti of my rest

 first lord . you must not enter . 
 paulina . nay , rather , good my lord , be second to me . 
 fear you hi tyrann passion more , ala , 
 than the queen 's life ? a graciou innoc soul , 
 more free than he is jealou . 
 antigonu . that 's enough . 
 second servant . madam , he hath not slept to-night ; command 
 none should come at him . 
 paulina . not so hot , good sir ; 
 i come to bring him sleep . 't is such as you , 
 that creep like shadow by him , and do sigh 
 at each hi needless heavings- such as you 
 nourish the caus of hi awak : i 
 do come with word as medicin as true , 
 honest as either , to purg him of that humour 
 that press him from sleep . 
 leont . what nois there , ho ? 
 paulina . no nois , my lord ; but need confer 
 about some gossip for your high . 
 leont . how ! 
 away with that audaci ladi ! antigonu , 
 i charg 'd thee that she should not come about me ; 
 i knew she would . 
 antigonu . i told her so , my lord , 
 on your displeasur 's peril , and on mine , 
 she should not visit you . 
 leont . what , canst not rule her ? 
 paulina . from all dishonesti he can : in thi , 
 unless he take the cours that you have done- 
 commit me for commit honour- trust it , 
 he shall not rule me . 
 antigonu . la you now , you hear ! 
 when she will take the rein , i let her run ; 
 but she 'll not stumbl . 
 paulina . good my lieg , i come- 
 and i beseech you hear me , who profess 
 myself your loyal servant , your physician , 
 your most obedi counsellor ; yet that dare 
 less appear so , in comfort your evil , 
 than such as most seem yours- i say i come 
 from your good queen . 
 leont . good queen ! 
 paulina . good queen , my lord , good queen- i say good queen ; 
 and would by combat make her good , so were i 
 a man , the worst about you . 
 leont . forc her henc . 
 paulina . let him that make but trifl of hi eye 
 first hand me . on mine own accord i 'll off ; 
 but first i 'll do my errand . the good queen , 
 for she is good , hath brought you forth a daughter ; 
 here 't is ; commend it to your bless . 
 [ lay down the child ] 
 leont . out ! 
 a mankind witch ! henc with her , out o ' door ! 
 a most intelligenc bawd ! 
 paulina . not so . 
 i am as ignor in that as you 
 in so entitl me ; and no less honest 
 than you are mad ; which is enough , i 'll warrant , 
 as thi world goe , to pass for honest . 
 leont . traitor ! 
 will you not push her out ? give her the bastard . 
 [ to antigonu ] thou dotard , thou art woman-tir 'd , unroost 
 by thi dame partlet here . take up the bastard ; 
 take't up , i say ; give't to thi crone .

 unvener be thi hand , if thou 
 tak'st up the princess by that forc base 
 which he ha put upo n't ! 
 leont . he dread hi wife . 
 paulina . so i would you did ; then 'twere past all doubt 
 you 'd call your children your . 
 leont . a nest of traitor ! 
 antigonu . i am none , by thi good light . 
 paulina . nor i ; nor ani 
 but one that 's here ; and that 's himself ; for he 
 the sacr honour of himself , hi queen 's , 
 hi hope son 's , hi babe 's , betray to slander , 
 whose sting is sharper than the sword 's ; and will not- 
 for , as the case now stand , it is a curs 
 he can not be compel 'd to 't- onc remov 
 the root of hi opinion , which is rotten 
 as ever oak or stone wa sound . 
 leont . a callat 
 of boundless tongu , who late hath beat her husband , 
 and now bait me ! thi brat is none of mine ; 
 it is the issu of polixen . 
 henc with it , and togeth with the dam 
 commit them to the fire . 
 paulina . it is your . 
 and , might we lay th ' old proverb to your charg , 
 so like you 't is the wors . behold , my lord , 
 although the print be littl , the whole matter 
 and copi of the father- eye , nose , lip , 
 the trick of 's frown , hi forehead ; nay , the valley , 
 the pretti dimpl of hi chin and cheek ; hi smile ; 
 the veri mould and frame of hand , nail , finger . 
 and thou , good goddess natur , which hast made it 
 so like to him that got it , if thou hast 
 the order of the mind too , 'mongst all colour 
 no yellow i n't , lest she suspect , as he doe , 
 her children not her husband 's ! 
 leont . a gross hag ! 
 and , lozel , thou art worthi to be hang 'd 
 that wilt not stay her tongu . 
 antigonu . hang all the husband 
 that can not do that feat , you 'll leav yourself 
 hardli one subject . 
 leont . onc more , take her henc .

 can do no more . 
 leont . i 'll ha ' thee burnt .

 it is an heret that make the fire , 
 not she which burn i n't . i 'll not call you tyrant 
 but thi most cruel usag of your queen- 
 not abl to produc more accus 
 than your own weak-h 'd fancy- someth savour 
 of tyranni , and will ignobl make you , 
 yea , scandal to the world . 
 leont . on your allegi , 
 out of the chamber with her ! were i a tyrant , 
 where were her life ? she durst not call me so , 
 if she did know me one . away with her !

 a better guid spirit ! what need these hand ?

 ever sinc it could speak , from an infant , freeli ,

 those of your fact are so- so past all truth ;

 there is an art which in their pied share

 yet natur is made better by no mean 
 but natur make that mean ; so over that art 
 which you say add to natur , is an art 
 that natur make . you see , sweet maid , we marri 
 a gentler scion to the wildest stock , 
 and make conceiv a bark of baser kind 
 by bud of nobler race . thi is an art 
 which doe mend nature- chang it rather ; but 
 the art itself is natur .

 the wind of march with beauti ; violet , dim 
 but sweeter than the lid of juno 's eye

 bright phoebu in hi strength- a maladi 
 most incid to maid ; bold oxlip , and

 i think there is not half a kiss to choos 
 who love anoth best .

 love-song for maid ; so without bawdri , which is strang ; with 
 such delic burden of dildo and fade , 'jump her and thump 
 her ' ; and where some stretch-mouth 'd rascal would , as it were , 
 mean mischief , and break a foul gap into the matter , he make the 
 maid to answer 'whoop , do me no harm , good man'- put him off ,

 camillo . thi is desper , sir . 
 florizel . so call it ; but it doe fulfil my vow : 
 i need must think it honesti . camillo , 
 not for bohemia , nor the pomp that may 
 be thereat glean 'd , for all the sun see or 
 the close earth womb , or the profound sea hide 
 in unknown fathom , will i break my oath

 when he shall miss me- as , in faith , i mean not 
 to see him ani more- cast your good counsel 
 upon hi passion . let myself and fortun 
 tug for the time to come . thi you may know , 
 and so deliv : i am put to sea 
 with her who here i can not hold on shore . 
 and most opportun to her need i have 
 a vessel ride fast by , but not prepar 'd 
 for thi design . what cours i mean to hold 
 shall noth benefit your knowledg , nor 
 concern me the report . 
 camillo . o my lord , 
 i would your spirit were easier for advic . 
 or stronger for your need . 
 florizel . hark , perdita . [ take her asid ] 
 [ to camillo ] i 'll hear you by and by . 
 camillo . he 's irremov , 
 resolv 'd for flight . now were i happi if 
 hi go i could frame to serv my turn , 
 save him from danger , do him love and honour , 
 purchas the sight again of dear sicilia 
 and that unhappi king , my master , whom 
 i so much thirst to see . 
 florizel . now , good camillo , 
 i am so fraught with curiou busi that 
 i leav out ceremoni . 
 camillo . sir , i think 
 you have heard of my poor servic i ' th ' love 
 that i have born your father ? 
 florizel . veri nobli 
 have you deserv 'd . it is my father 's music 
 to speak your deed ; not littl of hi care 
 to have them recompen 'd as thought on . 
 camillo . well , my lord , 
 if you may pleas to think i love the king , 
 and through him what 's nearest to him , which is 
 your graciou self , embrac but my direct . 
 if your more ponder and settl project 
 may suffer alter , on mine honour , 
 i 'll point you where you shall have such receiv 
 as shall becom your high ; where you may 
 enjoy your mistress , from the whom , i see , 
 there 's no disjunct to be made but by , 
 as heaven forfend ! your ruin- marri her ; 
 and with my best endeavour in your absenc 
 your discont father strive to qualifi , 
 and bring him up to like . 
 florizel . how , camillo , 
 may thi , almost a miracl , be done ? 
 that i may call thee someth more than man , 
 and after that trust to thee . 
 camillo . have you thought on 
 a place whereto you 'll go ? 
 florizel . not ani yet ; 
 but as th ' unthought-on accid is guilti 
 to what we wildli do , so we profess 
 ourselv to be the slave of chanc and fli 
 of everi wind that blow . 
 camillo . then list to me . 
 thi follow , if you will not chang your purpos 
 but undergo thi flight : make for sicilia , 
 and there present yourself and your fair princess- 
 for so , i see , she must be- fore leont . 
 she shall be habit as it becom 
 the partner of your bed . methink i see 
 leont open hi free arm and weep 
 hi welcom forth ; ask thee there 'son , forgiv ! ' 
 as 'twere i ' th ' father 's person ; kiss the hand 
 of your fresh princess ; o'er and o'er divid him 
 'twixt hi unkind and hi kindness- th ' one 
 he chide to hell , and bid the other grow 
 faster than thought or time . 
 florizel . worthi camillo , 
 what colour for my visit shall i 
 hold up befor him ? 
 camillo . sent by the king your father 
 to greet him and to give him comfort . sir , 
 the manner of your bear toward him , with 
 what you as from your father shall deliv , 
 thing known betwixt us three , i 'll write you down ; 
 the which shall point you forth at everi sit 
 what you must say , that he shall not perceiv 
 but that you have your father 's bosom there 
 and speak hi veri heart . 
 florizel . i am bound to you . 
 there is some sap in thi . 
 camillo . a cours more promis 
 than a wild dedic of yourselv 
 to unpath 'd water , undream 'd shore , most certain 
 to miseri enough ; no hope to help you , 
 but as you shake off one to take anoth ; 
 noth so certain as your anchor , who 
 do their best offic if they can but stay you 
 where you 'll be loath to be . besid , you know 
 prosper 's the veri bond of love , 
 whose fresh complexion and whose heart togeth 
 afflict alter . 
 perdita . one of these is true : 
 i think afflict may subdu the cheek , 
 but not take in the mind . 
 camillo . yea , say you so ? 
 there shall not at your father 's hous these seven year 
 be born anoth such . 
 florizel . my good camillo ,

 she is i ' th ' rear o ' our birth . 
 camillo . i can not say 't is piti 
 she lack instruct , for she seem a mistress 
 to most that teach . 
 perdita . your pardon , sir ; for thi 
 i 'll blush you thank . 
 florizel . my prettiest perdita ! 
 but , o , the thorn we stand upon ! camillo- 
 preserv of my father , now of me ; 
 the medicin of our house- how shall we do ? 
 we are not furnish 'd like bohemia 's son ; 
 nor shall appear in sicilia . 
 camillo . my lord , 
 fear none of thi . i think you know my fortun 
 do all lie there . it shall be so my care 
 to have you royal appoint as if 
 the scene you play were mine . for instanc , sir , 
 that you may know you shall not want- one word . 
 [ they talk asid ] 
 
 re-ent autolycu 
 
 autolycu . ha , ha ! what a fool honesti is ! and trust , hi sworn 
 brother , a veri simpl gentleman ! i have sold all my trumperi ; 
 not a counterfeit stone , not a ribbon , glass , pomand , brooch , 
 table-book , ballad , knife , tape , glove , shoe-ti , bracelet , 
 horn-r , to keep my pack from fast . they throng who should 
 buy first , as if my trinket had been hallow and brought a 
 benedict to the buyer ; by which mean i saw whose purs wa 
 best in pictur ; and what i saw , to my good use i rememb'r . my 
 clown , who want but someth to be a reason man , grew so in 
 love with the wench ' song that he would not stir hi pettito 
 till he had both tune and word , which so drew the rest of the 
 herd to me that all their other sens stuck in ear . you might 
 have pinch 'd a placket , it wa senseless ; 't wa noth to geld a 
 codpiec of a purs ; i would have fil 'd key off that hung in 
 chain . no hear , no feel , but my sir 's song , and admir 
 the noth of it . so that in thi time of lethargi i pick 'd and 
 cut most of their festiv purs ; and had not the old man come 
 in with whoobub against hi daughter and the king 's son and 
 scar 'd my chough from the chaff , i had not left a purs aliv in 
 the whole armi . 
 
 camillo , florizel , and perdita come forward 
 
 camillo . nay , but my letter , by thi mean be there 
 so soon as you arriv , shall clear that doubt . 
 florizel . and those that you 'll procur from king leont ? 
 camillo . shall satisfi your father . 
 perdita . happi be you ! 
 all that you speak show fair . 
 camillo . [ see autolycu ] who have we here ? 
 we 'll make an instrument of thi ; omit 
 noth may give us aid . 
 autolycu . [ asid ] if they have overheard me now- whi , hang . 
 camillo . how now , good fellow ! whi shak'st thou so ? 
 fear not , man ; here 's no harm intend to thee . 
 autolycu . i am a poor fellow , sir . 
 camillo . whi , be so still ; here 's nobodi will steal that from thee . 
 yet for the outsid of thi poverti we must make an exchang ; 
 therefor discas thee instantly- thou must think there 's a 
 necess in't- and chang garment with thi gentleman . though 
 the pennyworth on hi side be the worst , yet hold thee , there 's 
 some boot . [ give money ] 
 autolycu . i am a poor fellow , sir . [ asid ] i know ye well 
 enough . 
 camillo . nay , prithe dispatch . the gentleman is half flay 'd 
 alreadi . 
 autolycu . are you in camest , sir ? [ asid ] i smell the trick 
 o n't . 
 florizel . dispatch , i prithe . 
 autolycu . inde , i have had earnest ; but i can not with conscienc 
 take it . 
 camillo . unbuckl , unbuckl . 
 
 florizel and autolycu exchang garment 
 
 fortun mistress- let my propheci 
 come home to ye ! - you must retir yourself 
 into some covert ; take your sweetheart 's hat 
 and pluck it o'er your brow , muffl your face , 
 dismantl you , and , as you can , disliken 
 the truth of your own seem , that you may- 
 for i do fear eye over- to shipboard 
 get undescri . 
 perdita . i see the play so lie 
 that i must bear a part . 
 camillo . no remedi . 
 have you done there ? 
 florizel . should i now meet my father , 
 he would not call me son . 
 camillo . nay , you shall have no hat . 
 [ give it to perdita ] 
 come , ladi , come . farewel , my friend . 
 autolycu . adieu , sir . 
 florizel . o perdita , what have we twain forgot ! 
 pray you a word . [ they convers apart ] 
 camillo . [ asid ] what i do next shall be to tell the king 
 of thi escap , and whither they are bound ; 
 wherein my hope is i shall so prevail 
 to forc him after ; in whose compani 
 i shall re-view sicilia , for whose sight 
 i have a woman 's long . 
 florizel . fortun speed us ! 
 thu we set on , camillo , to th ' sea-sid . 
 camillo . the swifter speed the better . 
 exeunt florizel , perdita , and camillo 
 autolycu . i understand the busi , i hear it . to have an open 
 ear , a quick eye , and a nimbl hand , is necessari for a 
 cut-purs ; a good nose is requisit also , to smell out work for 
 th ' other sens . i see thi is the time that the unjust man doth 
 thrive . what an exchang had thi been without boot ! what a boot 
 is here with thi exchang ! sure , the god do thi year conniv 
 at us , and we may do anyth extempor . the princ himself is 
 about a piec of iniquity- steal away from hi father with hi 
 clog at hi heel . if i thought it were a piec of honesti to 
 acquaint the king withal , i would not do't . i hold it the more 
 knaveri to conceal it ; and therein am i constant to my

 becom none but tradesmen , and they often give us soldier the 
 lie ; but we pay them for it with stamp coin , not stab 
 steel ; therefor they do not give us the lie . 
 clown . your worship had like to have given us one , if you had not 
 taken yourself with the manner . 
 shepherd . are you a courtier , a n't like you , sir ? 
 autolycu . whether it like me or no , i am a courtier . seest thou 
 not the air of the court in these enfold ? hath not my gait in 
 it the measur of the court ? receiv not thi nose court-odour 
 from me ? reflect i not on thi base court-contempt ? think'st 
 thou , for that i insinu , that toaz from thee thi busi , i

 shepherd . sir , there lie such secret in thi fardel and box which 
 none must know but the king ; and which he shall know within thi 
 hour , if i may come to th ' speech of him . 
 autolycu . age , thou hast lost thi labour . 
 shepherd . whi , sir ? 
 autolycu . the king is not at the palac ; he is gone aboard a new 
 ship to purg melancholi and air himself ; for , if thou be'st 
 capabl of thing seriou , thou must know the king is full of 
 grief . 
 shepherd . so 't is said , sir- about hi son , that should have 
 marri a shepherd 's daughter . 
 autolycu . if that shepherd be not in hand-fast , let him fli ; the

 back of man , the heart of monster . 
 clown . think you so , sir ? 
 autolycu . not he alon shall suffer what wit can make heavi and 
 vengeanc bitter ; but those that are german to him , though 
 remov 'd fifti time , shall all come under the hangman- which , 
 though it be great piti , yet it is necessari . an old 
 sheep-whistl rogu , a ram-tend , to offer to have hi 
 daughter come into grace ! some say he shall be ston 'd ; but that 
 death is too soft for him , say i. draw our throne into a 
 sheep-cot ! - all death are too few , the sharpest too easi . 
 clown . ha the old man e'er a son , sir , do you hear , a n't like you , 
 sir ? 
 autolycu . he ha a son- who shall be flay 'd aliv ; then 'noint 
 over with honey , set on the head of a wasp 's nest ; then stand 
 till he be three quarter and a dram dead ; then recov 'd again 
 with aqua-vita or some other hot infus ; then , raw as he is , 
 and in the hottest day prognost proclaim , shall he be set 
 against a brick wall , the sun look with a southward eye upon 
 him , where he is to behold him with fli blown to death . but 
 what talk we of these traitorli rascal , whose miseri are to be 
 smil 'd at , their offenc be so capit ? tell me , for you seem 
 to be honest plain men , what you have to the king . be 
 someth gentli consid 'd , i 'll bring you where he is aboard , 
 tender your person to hi presenc , whisper him in your behalf ; 
 and if it be in man besid the king to effect your suit , here 
 is man shall do it . 
 clown . he seem to be of great author . close with him , give him 
 gold ; and though author be a stubborn bear , yet he is oft led 
 by the nose with gold . show the insid of your purs to the 
 outsid of hi hand , and no more ado . remember- ston 'd and flay 'd

 old man doe , when the busi is perform ; and remain , as he 
 say , your pawn till it be brought you . 
 autolycu . i will trust you . walk befor toward the sea-sid ; go on 
 the right-hand ; i will but look upon the hedg , and follow you .

 act v. scene i . 
 sicilia . the palac of leont 
 
 enter leont , cleomen , dion , paulina , and other 
 
 cleomen . sir , you have done enough , and have perform 'd 
 a saint-lik sorrow . no fault could you make 
 which you have not redeem 'd ; inde , paid down 
 more penit than done trespass . at the last , 
 do as the heaven have done : forget your evil ; 
 with them forgiv yourself . 
 leont . whilst i rememb 
 her and her virtu , i can not forget 
 my blemish in them , and so still think of 
 the wrong i did myself ; which wa so much 
 that heirless it hath made my kingdom , and 
 destroy 'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man 
 bred hi hope out of . 
 paulina . true , too true , my lord . 
 if , one by one , you wed all the world , 
 or from the all that are took someth good 
 to make a perfect woman , she you kill 'd 
 would be unparallel 'd . 
 leont . i think so . kill 'd ! 
 she i kill 'd ! i did so ; but thou strik'st me 
 sore , to say i did . it is as bitter 
 upon thi tongu as in my thought . now , good now , 
 say so but seldom . 
 cleomen . not at all , good ladi . 
 you might have spoken a thousand thing that would 
 have done the time more benefit , and grac 'd 
 your kind better . 
 paulina . you are one of those 
 would have him wed again . 
 dion . if you would not so , 
 you piti not the state , nor the remembr 
 of hi most sovereign name ; consid littl 
 what danger , by hi high ' fail of issu , 
 may drop upon hi kingdom and devour 
 incertain lookers-on . what were more holi 
 than to rejoic the former queen is well ? 
 what holier than , for royalti 's repair , 
 for present comfort , and for futur good , 
 to bless the bed of majesti again 
 with a sweet fellow to't ? 
 paulina . there is none worthi , 
 respect her that 's gone . besid , the god 
 will have fulfil 'd their secret purpos ; 
 for ha not the divin apollo said , 
 is't not the tenour of hi oracl , 
 that king leont shall not have an heir 
 till hi lost child be found ? which that it shall , 
 is all as monstrou to our human reason 
 as my antigonu to break hi grave 
 and come again to me ; who , on my life , 
 did perish with the infant . 't is your counsel 
 my lord should to the heaven be contrari , 
 oppos against their will . [ to leont ] care not for issu ; 
 the crown will find an heir . great alexand 
 left hi to th ' worthiest ; so hi successor 
 wa like to be the best . 
 leont . good paulina , 
 who hast the memori of hermion , 
 i know , in honour , o that ever i 
 had squar 'd me to thi counsel ! then , even now , 
 i might have look 'd upon my queen 's full eye , 
 have taken treasur from her lips- 
 paulina . and left them 
 more rich for what they yield . 
 leont . thou speak'st truth . 
 no more such wive ; therefor , no wife . one wors , 
 and better us 'd , would make her saint spirit 
 again possess her corps , and on thi stage , 
 where we offend her now , appear soul-vex 'd , 
 and begin 'whi to me'- 
 paulina . had she such power , 
 she had just caus . 
 leont . she had ; and would incens me 
 to murder her i marri . 
 paulina . i should so . 
 were i the ghost that walk 'd , i 'd bid you mark 
 her eye , and tell me for what dull part i n't 
 you chose her ; then i 'd shriek , that even your ear 
 should rift to hear me ; and the word that follow 'd 
 should be 'rememb mine . ' 
 leont . star , star , 
 and all eye els dead coal ! fear thou no wife ; 
 i 'll have no wife , paulina . 
 paulina . will you swear 
 never to marri but by my free leav ? 
 leont . never , paulina ; so be blest my spirit ! 
 paulina . then , good my lord , bear wit to hi oath . 
 cleomen . you tempt him over-much . 
 paulina . unless anoth , 
 as like hermion as is her pictur , 
 affront hi eye . 
 cleomen . good madam- 
 paulina . i have done . 
 yet , if my lord will marry- if you will , sir , 
 no remedi but you will- give me the offic 
 to choos you a queen . she shall not be so young 
 as wa your former ; but she shall be such 
 as , walk 'd your first queen 's ghost , it should take joy 
 to see her in your arm . 
 leont . my true paulina , 
 we shall not marri till thou bid'st us . 
 paulina . that 
 shall be when your first queen 's again in breath ; 
 never till then .

 like to hi father 's great . hi approach , 
 so out of circumst and sudden , tell us 
 't is not a visit fram 'd , but forc 'd 
 by need and accid . what train ? 
 gentleman . but few , 
 and those but mean . 
 leont . hi princess , say you , with him ? 
 gentleman . ay ; the most peerless piec of earth , i think , 
 that e'er the sun shone bright on . 
 paulina . o hermion , 
 as everi present time doth boast itself 
 abov a better gone , so must thi grave 
 give way to what 's seen now ! sir , you yourself 
 have said and writ so , but your write now 
 is colder than that theme : 'she had not been , 
 nor wa not to be equal 'd . ' thu your vers 
 flow 'd with her beauti onc ; 't is shrewdli ebb 'd , 
 to say you have seen a better . 
 gentleman . pardon , madam . 
 the one i have almost forgot- your pardon ; 
 the other , when she ha obtain 'd your eye , 
 will have your tongu too . thi is a creatur , 
 would she begin a sect , might quench the zeal 
 of all professor els , make proselyt 
 of who she but bid follow . 
 paulina . how ! not women ? 
 gentleman . women will love her that she is a woman 
 more worth than ani man ; men , that she is 
 the rarest of all women . 
 leont . go , cleomen ; 
 yourself , assist with your honour 'd friend , 
 bring them to our embrac . exeunt 
 still , 't is strang 
 he thu should steal upon us . 
 paulina . had our princ , 
 jewel of children , seen thi hour , he had pair 'd 
 well with thi lord ; there wa not full a month 
 between their birth . 
 leont . prithe no more ; ceas . thou know'st 
 he die to me again when talk 'd of . sure , 
 when i shall see thi gentleman , thi speech 
 will bring me to consid that which may 
 unfurnish me of reason .

 the land and water 'twixt your throne and hi 
 measur 'd , to look upon you ; whom he love ,

 and those that bear them live . 
 leont . o my brother- 
 good gentleman ! - the wrong i have done thee stir 
 afresh within me ; and these thi offic , 
 so rare kind , are as interpret 
 of my behind-hand slack ! welcom hither , 
 as is the spring to th ' earth . and hath he too 
 expo 'd thi paragon to th ' fear usag , 
 at least ungentl , of the dread neptun , 
 to greet a man not worth her pain , much less 
 th ' adventur of her person ? 
 florizel . good , my lord ,

 scene ii . 
 sicilia . befor the palac of leont 
 
 enter autolycu and a gentleman 
 
 autolycu . beseech you , sir , were you present at thi relat ? 
 first gentleman . i wa by at the open of the fardel , heard the 
 old shepherd deliv the manner how he found it ; whereupon , after 
 a littl amazed , we were all command out of the chamber ; 
 onli thi , methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child . 
 autolycu . i would most gladli know the issu of it . 
 first gentleman . i make a broken deliveri of the busi ; but the 
 chang i perceiv in the king and camillo were veri note of 
 admir . they seem 'd almost , with stare on one anoth , to 
 tear the case of their eye ; there wa speech in their dumb , 
 languag in their veri gestur ; they look 'd as they had heard of 
 a world ransom 'd , or one destroy . a notabl passion of wonder 
 appear in them ; but the wisest behold that knew no more but 
 see could not say if th ' import were joy or sorrow- but in 
 the extrem of the one it must need be . 
 
 enter anoth gentleman 
 
 here come a gentleman that happili know more . the news , rogero ? 
 second gentleman . noth but bonfir . the oracl is fulfil 'd : 
 the king 's daughter is found . such a deal of wonder is broken out 
 within thi hour that ballad-mak can not be abl to express it . 
 
 enter anoth gentleman 
 
 here come the ladi paulina 's steward ; he can deliv you more . 
 how goe it now , sir ? thi news , which is call 'd true , is so like 
 an old tale that the veriti of it is in strong suspicion . ha the 
 king found hi heir ? 
 third gentleman . most true , if ever truth were pregnant by 
 circumst . that which you hear you 'll swear you see , there is 
 such uniti in the proof . the mantl of queen hermion 's ; her 
 jewel about the neck of it ; the letter of antigonu found with 
 it , which they know to be hi charact ; the majesti of the 
 creatur in resembl of the mother ; the affect of nobl 
 which natur show abov her breed ; and mani other evidences- 
 proclaim her with all certainti to be the king 's daughter . did 
 you see the meet of the two king ? 
 second gentleman . no . 
 third gentleman . then you have lost a sight which wa to be seen , 
 can not be spoken of . there might you have beheld one joy crown 
 anoth , so and in such manner that it seem 'd sorrow wept to take 
 leav of them ; for their joy wade in tear . there wa cast up 
 of eye , hold up of hand , with counten of such 
 distract that they were to be known by garment , not by favour . 
 our king , be readi to leap out of himself for joy of hi found 
 daughter , as if that joy were now becom a loss , cri ' o , thi 
 mother , thi mother ! ' then ask bohemia forgiv ; then embrac 
 hi son-in-law ; then again worri he hi daughter with clip 
 her . now he thank the old shepherd , which stand by like a 
 weather-bitten conduit of mani king ' reign . i never heard of 
 such anoth encount , which lame report to follow it and 
 undo descript to do it . 
 second gentleman . what , pray you , becam of antigonu , that carri 
 henc the child ? 
 third gentleman . like an old tale still , which will have matter to 
 rehears , though credit be asleep and not an ear open : he wa 
 torn to piec with a bear . thi avouch the shepherd 's son , who 
 ha not onli hi innoc , which seem much , to justifi him , but 
 a handkerchief and ring of hi that paulina know . 
 first gentleman . what becam of hi bark and hi follow ? 
 third gentleman . wreck 'd the same instant of their master 's death , 
 and in the view of the shepherd ; so that all the instrument 
 which aid to expos the child were even then lost when it wa 
 found . but , o , the nobl combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow wa 
 fought in paulina ! she had one eye declin 'd for the loss of her 
 husband , anoth elev that the oracl wa fulfil 'd . she 
 lift the princess from the earth , and so lock her in embrac 
 as if she would pin her to her heart , that she might no more be 
 in danger of lose . 
 first gentleman . the digniti of thi act wa worth the audienc of 
 king and princ ; for by such wa it act . 
 third gentleman . one of the prettiest touch of all , and that 
 which angl 'd for mine eyes- caught the water , though not the 
 fish- wa , when at the relat of the queen 's death , with the 
 manner how she came to't brave confess 'd and lament by the 
 king , how attentiven wound hi daughter ; till , from one sign 
 of dolour to anoth , she did with an 'ala ! '- i would fain say- 
 bleed tear ; for i am sure my heart wept blood . who wa most 
 marbl there chang colour ; some swoon , all sorrow . if all 
 the world could have see n't , the woe had been univers . 
 first gentleman . are they return to the court ? 
 third gentleman . no . the princess hear of her mother 's statu , 
 which is in the keep of paulina- a piec mani year in do 
 and now newli perform 'd by that rare italian master , julio 
 romano , who , had he himself etern and could put breath into 
 hi work , would beguil natur of her custom , so perfectli he is 
 her ape . he so near to hermion hath done hermion that they say 
 one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer- thither with 
 all greedi of affect are they gone , and there they intend 
 to sup . 
 second gentleman . i thought she had some great matter there in 
 hand ; for she hath privat twice or thrice a day , ever sinc 
 the death of hermion , visit that remov hous . shall we 
 thither , and with our compani piec the rejoic ? 
 first gentleman . who would be thenc that ha the benefit of 
 access ? everi wink of an eye some new grace will be born . our 
 absenc make us unthrifti to our knowledg . let 's along . 
 exeunt gentlemen 
 autolycu . now , had i not the dash of my former life in me , would 
 prefer drop on my head . i brought the old man and hi son 
 aboard the princ ; told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i 
 know not what ; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd 's 
 daughter- so he then took her to be- who began to be much 
 sea-sick , and himself littl better , extrem of weather 
 continu , thi mysteri remain undiscov 'd . but 't is all one 
 to me ; for had i been the finder-out of thi secret , it would not 
 have relish 'd among my other discredit . 
 
 enter shepherd and clown 
 
 here come those i have done good to against my will , and alreadi 
 appear in the blossom of their fortun .

 daughter will be all gentlemen born .
