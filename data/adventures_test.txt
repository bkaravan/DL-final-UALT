With this, the energetic master mariner tossed down a gin rickey, said
adieu to Captain O’Shea, and whisked McDougal out of the place with
an arm across his shoulders. The episode made O’Shea feel slightly
bewildered. The unfortunate McDougal had appeared and vanished with an
abruptness that savored of unreality. His confession was the sort of
thing that might come to a man in a nightmare. McDougal had painted
the scenes with a few broad strokes, and yet as O’Shea sat musing,
they seemed astonishingly vivid: the aged Chinese official pulling his
coat about his neck just before his head bounced off like a bloody
ball--the ragged colossus of a street pedler flinging afar his resonant
call--McDougal, wretched and forlorn, huddled in the tea-house and
fighting off the horrors. He had opened the book of his life and let
O’Shea read a page of it, but there must have been many more worth
knowing.

These reflections were interrupted by a violent dissension in the
vicinity of the bar. A British tar smote a Scandinavian over the head
with a bottle and stretched him on the floor. Somebody plucked the
piano stool from under the musical cabin steward and hurled it at the
aggressor. The missile flew high and swept the bar-tender into his
glassware with a most splendid crash. Then hostilities became general.

The combatants were too busy to observe the entrance of a wizened,
clerical-looking little man in a black frock-coat and a rusty tall hat.
With a shrill whoop, he pulled a slung-shot from his pocket and pranced
into the thick of the scrimmage. He was as agile as a jumping-jack, his
coat-tails seemed to be flying in a dozen places at once, and whenever
his weapon landed a seaman promptly lost all interest in the row and
made for the street with his head tenderly held in his hands. In the
wake of the active little man peace hovered like a dove.

With magical celerity the floor was cleared of disorder, and the
promoter of harmony calmly assisted the damaged bar-tender to clear
away the wreckage. Captain O’Shea accosted him when the task was
finished.

“Paddy Blake is me name,” the little man replied in a jerky, rasping
voice, cocking his head to one side. “The boys will have their fun and
I hope they didn’t annoy ye. The place will be quiet for a bit. What
can I do for ye?”

“’Tis a matter of private business,” answered O’Shea.

“Then come into the back room, where we can be sociable. I take ye for
a shipmaster.”

“Right you are; but I have no ship at present. You might call me a
tourist.”

Paddy Blake briskly led the way to a cubby-hole of a room with a
very strong door, which he made fast with a bolt. There was a window
whose shutters were of iron. O’Shea suspected that fuddled seamen
might be tucked in here for safe-keeping when the occasion required.
The two Irishmen studied each other with a kind of cheerful, candid
appraisement. Each recognized in the other certain qualities to
be admired. Paddy Blake was a hardened old ruffian, but he was a
two-fisted little man with the courage of a terrier.

“I have come a long way to find you,” said O’Shea. “And it was imparted
to me that the business that has brought me to China had best be
discussed in whispers. ’Tis a mighty queer yarn----”

“Ye need not fill and back. Steam ahead. I like your looks,” broke in
Paddy Blake. “Whatever passes bechune us stays inside the door. Are ye
in throuble?”

“Not me. This is about a friend of mine. Tell me, Paddy Blake, and
think hard. Do ye recall a strappin’ big man with red hair and blue
eyes and a deep voice that used to roll the dice in your place? Hold
a minute; I have not done with him. One front tooth was broken so you
would notice it when he talked. And he had a crooked little finger that
must have stuck out when he held a glass or waved his hand about.”

Paddy Blake puckered his brows and pinched his long upper lip between a
grimy thumb and forefinger.

“What was he--a Yankee?” he asked, sitting straighter in his chair and
gazing at the shipmaster with puzzled, groping interest.

“He was an American seafarin’ man--a mate most likely. You could not
forget him if you cast eyes on him only once. Yankee sailors are scarce
in deep-water ports. This one should stick out in your recollection
like a light-house in a fog.”

“A whale of a man with a red head and an eye as blue as a bit of the
Inland Sea!” vehemently exclaimed Paddy Blake. “And when was he in me
place? How long ago was it?”

“’Tis yourself that must answer that question. At a guess, it was more
than a year ago.”

The spry little man bounded to his feet and clutched the tails of his
coat with both hands as he bent forward with his face close to O’Shea’s
and rasped out:

“He has popped into me head like a flash. And a mushy-brained dunce I
was not to know him at once. Eldridge ye mean--Jim Eldridge, that was
mate in the China Navigation Company’s steamer _Tai Yan_, chartered
to run coastwise. A whoppin’ big beggar he was, but mild-mannered and
good-hearted, the quietest red-headed man that iver I saw in me life.”

“Are you sure of that?” demanded O’Shea. “Could you swear to it?”

“I remimber him as plain as I see you,” testily returned Paddy Blake.
“He was not in me place often. ’Twas too rough for him.”

“And did you ever chance to hear what had become of him?”

The little man tapped O’Shea’s arm with an eloquent finger and replied
in lower tones:

“It comes back to me that there was a yarn about him. ’Twas gossip,
ye understand, nawthin’ that ye could put your finger on. Shanghai is
a great place for wild stories. The Shanghai liar is a special breed,
and he is famous all over the world. Annyhow, there was a voyage of the
_Tai Yan_ steamer when he didn’t come to port in her. Shortly after
that she broke her back on a reef in the Formosa Channel and all hands
was lost, so I never heard anny news from her people about this Jim
Eldridge.”

“That was most unfortunate,” said O’Shea; “but I am in great luck to
get track of the man at all. And have you anybody in mind that might
have known Eldridge when he was sailing on this coast?”

The volatile Paddy Blake who saw so many mariners pass through his
place during the year was mentally sifting his recollections which were
many and confusing. The big red-headed man had steered clear of rum and
riot and was no steady frequenter of this unholy resort. Obviously he
had made no more than a passing impression on Paddy Blake, but the old
man was honestly anxious to splice the broken ends of the story, and
after painful cogitation he broke out again:

“There is one man that ye should find by all means. He may be dead by
now, for the liquor had harrd hold of him. I have not seen or heard
of him in a long while, but he wint north from here. I mind the last
time he come in me place. Pretty well pickled he was, and some o’ the
lads were yarnin’ with him, and there was talk of this Jim Eldridge.
Be gob! ’twas then I heard the queer gossip, in bits, d’ ye see? There
had been a ruction somewheres up beyant”--and Paddy Blake waved a hand
to the northward--“and this man I mintion had been mixed in it with Jim
Eldridge. But when they would urge him to unwind the story he would
turn ugly and shut up like an oyster, half-seas-over though he was. He
was a great one for messin’ about among the Chinese, and could patter
two or three dialects. A scholar and gentleman was McDougal.”

“McDougal!” roared O’Shea, taken all aback by the coincidence. “Why,
man alive, this same McDougal was in your place to-night and left
not an hour ago. He has just come down the coast, from Tientsin and
Che-Foo.”

“’Tis a pity ye let him get away. If he wanders into the Chinese city
amongst some of thim native friends of his ’twill be the divil and all
to find him again. So he’s still alive!”

“I sat and talked with him and he discoursed nightmares.”

“He has lived thim,” said Paddy Blake.

“I had him and I lost him,” was O’Shea’s melancholy exclamation. “An
oakum-whiskered Dutchman by the name of Spreckels breezed in under full
sail and welcomed this McDougal like a long-lost brother, and carried
him off to sea before ye could blink. It was comical. And I sat there
like a wooden figure-head and let him go.”

“In the _Wilhelmina Augusta_--four-masted steel bark bound out to
Hamburg. It was a lucky stroke for McDougal.”

“And most unlucky for me,” sighed O’Shea. Then he pulled himself
together, and spoke in his hearty, masterful way. “Come along, Paddy
Blake, and find me a tug. We will chase McDougal down river for the
sake of a conversation with him.”

“Captain Spreckels had the _Arrow_, and she’s fast,” said Paddy Blake.
“He has a good start of ye, and his bark will be ready to sail as soon
as he boards her.”

“Then we’ll chase him out to sea. I have come too far to lose McDougal
by letting him slip through me fingers,” and the demeanor of Captain
Michael O’Shea discouraged further argument.

Paddy Blake jammed the tall hat on the back of his head, unbolted
the door, and whisked through the bar-room with such speed that the
shipmaster’s long strides could hardly keep up with him. They turned
into the street that led to the water-front and hastened to a lighted
corner of the bund where stood several ’rickshaws. Paddy darted at the
drowsy coolies who were squatted on the pavement, cuffed a couple of
them, and gave an order in pidgin English. They jumped into the shafts,
the passengers climbed aboard, and the vehicles went spinning along the
thoroughfare.

As they drew abreast of the lights of the anchored shipping, Paddy
Blake looked along the landing-berths of the smaller steamers and
exclaimed with an explosion of profane surprise:

“There’s a tug in the pocket where the _Arrow_ ties up. I can’t see to
make her out in the dark, but we will stop and take a look. Something
or other may have delayed Captain Spreckels. I hope to blazes thim
seamen I sint him has not hooked it before he got ’em safe aboard the
bark.”

Leaving the ’rickshaws to wait orders, they footed it down to the wharf
and were convinced that they had found the _Arrow_ even before she
could be clearly made out. The darkness was shattered by the troubled
accents of Captain Spreckels, who was proclaiming to the skipper of the
tug:

“By Gott, I cannot wait for McDougal no longer. The tide ist turned
already. My wessel must go to sea mit the morning flood. It gives me
sadness to lose dot scalawag, but he has runned away mit himself.”

O’Shea climbed over the guard-rail and cried:

“How are you again, Captain Spreckels? What’s this I hear about
McDougal? I am after finding him meself.”

The master of the _Wilhelmina Augusta_ swung his arms and made answer:

“McDougal was a slippery customer, so? I haf a immense fondness for
him. By the landing here he left me to go in a ’rickshaw, _sehr
schnell_, to a room what he haf hired for to-night und fetch some
little t’ings what belonged to him, mostly books und some papers mit
writings on ’em. He haf come to Shanghai, he tells me, mit a small
bundle which he never loses, drunk or sober. While the tug is makin’
steam und haulin’ her lines aboard he will do his errand. It vas an
hour ago. I do not understand, but I must not wait.”

“Changed his mind,” suggested Paddy Blake. “Sorry ye are shy a
shipmate, but the news will please me friend Captain O’Shea here. You
lose. He wins.”

The hull of the _Arrow_ was trembling to the thresh of the screw,
and her skipper was bawling the order to cast off. Captain Spreckels
shouted farewell as the two visitors jumped ashore, and the tug moved
astern into the fair-way. As they walked toward the ’rickshaws O’Shea
remarked:

“’Tis no use to go rummagin’ around to-night in search of McDougal, I
suppose.”

“No, but I will find him for ye to-morrow,” replied Paddy Blake. “If he
has a room in the English quarter ye can gamble he will drop into my
place. If he don’t I will sind a bright lad to round him up. ’Tis easy
findin’ him as long as he is not livin’ in the native city. What do ye
suppose become of him, annyhow?”

“Maybe he flinched from the notion of quitting the East. When it gets
in the blood of these tropical tramps, the grip of it is not easy to
break.”

“And he lost his nerve at the last minute,” said Paddy Blake. “I’ve
seen cases like it. I’m that way meself.”

Declining a cordial invitation to have a “nightcap,” O’Shea told his
’rickshaw cooly to take him to the Astor House. It seemed extraordinary
that his quixotic pilgrimage should have so soon disclosed the identity
of the derelict who had drifted into the comfortable haven of Johnny
Kent’s farm. This, however, did not greatly astonish O’Shea, who knew
that the steps of sailormen in alien ports are not apt to stray far
from the water-side. The singular feature of the business was that he
should run across the sodden beach-comber, McDougal, who was the needle
in a hay-stack of prodigious size. The hand of destiny was in it.

At breakfast next morning Captain O’Shea enjoyed overhearing the talk
of a party of American tourists at a near-by table. In their turn the
younger women did not fail to observe with interest the clean-cut,
resolute shipmaster smartly turned out in fresh white clothes. After
they had left the dining-room he picked up a copy of _The Shanghai
Mercury_ and carelessly turned to the shipping news where these lines
caught his eye:

    Bark _Wilhelmina Augusta_, Spreckels master, cleared for Hamburg
    with general cargo. Sailed Woosung this A. M.

This turned his thoughts to McDougal and he was impatient to find Paddy
Blake and begin the search. He was about to toss the newspaper aside
when a paragraph seemed to jump from the page and hit him between the
eyes. He read it slowly, his lips moving as if he were spelling out the
words:


                    UNKNOWN EUROPEAN MYSTERIOUSLY KILLED

    Late last night the body of a middle-aged man was discovered in the
    Rue Pechili by an officer of the French municipal police. The place
    was only a few yards from one of the gate-ways of the native city
    wall in a quarter which is largely populated by Chinese who have
    overflowed into the French quarter. The man had been dead only a
    short time. He is supposed to have been an American or Englishman,
    although his identity was unknown at the hour of going to press. He
    was clothed in gray tweeds badly worn and had the appearance of one
    who had suffered from dissipation. He had been stabbed from behind,
    in addition to which his body was savagely gashed and mutilated.
    The British police were notified and Inspector Burke immediately
    took charge of the case.

Captain O’Shea’s second cup of coffee stood cold and neglected while
he continued to gaze abstractedly at the front page of _The Shanghai
Mercury_. He was reading between the printed lines. His sun-browned
face had paled a trifle. He was not afraid, but he was conscious of
that same feeling of physical abhorrence which had taken hold of him
when he first beheld the scarred and branded back of the man dubbed
Bill Maguire.

He was absolutely certain that he could identify the “unknown European”
found dead near a gate-way of the native city. It was McDougal, and
he had been slain because in some manner, as yet unrevealed, he had
played a part in the tragic mystery of the red-haired sailor. Intuition
welded the circumstances together. With this premise O’Shea framed one
swift conclusion after another. McDougal had suddenly veered from his
purpose of going to sea with Captain Spreckels. With the morbid impulse
of a man whose nerves were shattered by drink, he had been afraid lest
the German skipper might find him and carry him off whether or no.
Therefore he had fled to cover, making for the native city where he
doubtless had Chinese friends. Perhaps he had been watched and followed
by hostile agents from the moment he landed in Shanghai.

“I have seen others like him,” said O’Shea to himself. “They will run
from their own shadows, and their friends can do nothing with them. And
I must be getting a bit flighty meself or I would not sit here and take
for granted things that are no more than guesswork. How do I know that
the dead man is McDougal? The answer is this: ’Tis one of me strong
hunches, and they seldom go wrong.”

He passed out of the dining-room and delayed in the office of the
hotel to ask a question of the clerk. The atmosphere of the place was
so wholly European that the China, with which O’Shea had come darkly,
gropingly in touch, seemed almost as far away as when he had been on
the farm in Maine. The clerk went to the porch and gave instructions to
a ’rickshaw cooly, and Captain O’Shea rattled off to the headquarters
buildings of the English police. A Sikh orderly conducted him into
the small room where Inspector Burke sat at a desk scanning a file
of reports. He was a tall, dark, soldierly man of about forty. The
slim-waisted khaki tunic, the riding-breeches, and the polished brown
puttees gave him the air of a dashing trooper of light-horse. Glancing
at O’Shea’s card, he nodded pleasantly and said with a singularly
winning smile:

“And what can I do for Captain Michael O’Shea, of New York? I am very
much at your service.”

“’Tis about the man that was found murdered close by the native city
last night,” was the reply.

“Ah, by Jove!” exclaimed the inspector, and his pencil tapped the desk
with a quick tattoo. “An odd case, that! Most unusual. I was potterin’
about on it a good part of the night. My men report that he was in
Paddy Blake’s place during the evening, but the old rip denies knowing
him, of course. He wants to steer clear of the case. I’m rather
stumped so far. You are at the Astor House? I fancy I saw you there at
dinner last night.”

“Right you are, sir. I am more than a little interested in this dead
man,” pursued O’Shea in a straightforward manner. “And I will first
describe him to ye,” which he proceeded to do with the detail of an
observer whose eye was keen and memory retentive.

“That’s the Johnny, to a dot,” cried Inspector Burke, alertly
interested. “And when did you last see him?”

“I talked with him last night, but before we go further I will prove an
alibi,” hastily answered O’Shea, suddenly realizing that his position
in the matter might look compromising.

“Don’t trouble yourself,” was the easy assurance. “You are jolly well
out of it and satisfactorily accounted for. This was a native job, not
a bit of doubt of it. Suppose we take a look at the body. It is packed
in ice in the go-down just back of this building. Your identification
must go on the records, you know. Then we can have a chin-chin, and I
hope you’ll be good enough to stay for tiffin with me.”

O’Shea took from an inside pocket of his coat a leather bill-case and
drew therefrom a sheet of heavy paper folded several times. Spread
out, it covered half the desk. Upon it he had drawn with a brush and
stencilling ink a life-size reproduction of the great Chinese character
that scarred and discolored the back of the red-haired sailor.

Inspector Burke flung his cigarette aside with a quick gesture and
stared first at the desk and then at O’Shea. His pleasant composure was
evidently disturbed, and he spoke abruptly.

“My word! You know a lot more about this job than I do. Where the deuce
did you get that? The poor beggar that was butchered last night had the
mark on him.”

“I know he did, Inspector Burke. I was sure of it when I read about the
thing in the newspaper this morning.”

They went into the shed and viewed what was left of the ill-fated
McDougal, who had tried, too late, to throw all regrets away and make
a new start at the difficult business of existence. O’Shea was keenly
distressed. The man had won his sympathy. He would have liked to
befriend him. Inspector Burke said kindly:

“Did you know him at all well? He must have amounted to something once.
Was he ever a chum of yours?”

“I never laid eyes on him till last evening in Paddy Blake’s,” answered
O’Shea. “And now I will sit down with ye and spin the yarn of the
sailorman that I called Bill Maguire for convenience.”

The inspector listened gravely, nodding comprehendingly now and then as
if his own experience might have crossed the trail of the same story.
When O’Shea ceased talking, his comment was as follows:

“Most extraordinary! I fancy we can help each other a bit. But, mind
you, I don’t pretend to know much about this mysterious murder society
that goes about choppin’ people up. I have heard of it, of course, but
until now its activities have been confined to the Chinese. We don’t
pretend to police the native city. The Chinese governor runs his own
show. There are native detectives on my staff, but their work is mostly
in the foreign municipality. The case of this McDougal is the first of
its kind. And I rather think you have supplied the motive. He knew too
much.”

“But what did he know?” demanded O’Shea. “There was this sailor by the
right name of Jim Eldridge, ye understand. He got his in the same way.
They were mixed up together at one time or another.”

Inspector Burke withdrew from a drawer of his desk a large envelope
and emptied out several torn sheets and fragments of paper which
looked as though they had been trampled underfoot. Some were covered
with handwriting in English, while others held columns of Chinese
characters. They were so mud-stained and crumpled, however, that only
a few lines here and there were at all legible. O’Shea gazed at them
eagerly, surmising what they were before the inspector explained:

“My men picked them up in the street where McDougal’s body was found.”

“Yes. He must have had a bundle of books and papers under his arm,
for I heard mention of the same,” cried O’Shea. “Like enough, it was
ripped apart in the scrimmage and the blood-thirsty heathen made off
with whatever they could lay their hands on in a hurry. If they spied
any Chinese writing they would grab at it. What do ye say, Inspector
Burke?”

“There are bits of some sort of a diary here, Captain O’Shea, and
odds and ends that only a native could make head or tail of. I looked
them over early this morning, and one of my Chinese did what he could
to help. It is impossible to arrange the fragments in any sequence,
but the story you tell me dovetails rather curiously with some of the
sentences.”

“There was many queer things stowed away in that noddle of his,” said
O’Shea, “and he was an educated man, so he would be apt to make notes
of them. And does he make any mention at all of this Jim Eldridge,
alias Bill Maguire?”

Inspector Burke carefully smoothed a torn sheet of paper and laid a
finger on a few lines scrawled in a shaky hand. They held no reference
to the sailor, but several phrases were startlingly familiar to Captain
O’Shea. The mutilated passage ran thus:

    _Very horrid dreams last night--brandy failed to drive them away.
    Was in a steamer on the Stinking River--the Painted Joss came
    through the cabin port-hole, squeezing itself small as if made
    of rubber, and then expanding to gigantic size. It strangled me
    slowly, making hideous faces. This is a warning--When I dream of
    the Painted Joss, I am on the edge of seeing things while awake.
    The fear of violent death is...._

Captain O’Shea was vividly reminded of the disjointed monologue of Bill
Maguire, who had shown symptoms of a similar antipathy to the “Painted
Joss.”

“McDougal wrote down the Stinking River as if it was a real name,” he
said to Inspector Burke. “I thought Maguire called it that because it
smelled bad. If it is on the map, can ye locate it, and is there by any
chance a town with the title of Wang-Li-Fu on the banks of the same?”

Inspector Burke summoned a fat, drowsy-looking interpreter and put
several questions to him. After poring over an atlas for some time,
this owlish Chinese gentleman vouchsafed the information that a
navigable stream known as the River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells did
indeed flow through a coastwise part of Kiangsu province, emptying into
the wide estuary of the old mouth of the Yellow River. There was a city
in that region which had been great and flourishing until the Tai-Ping
Rebellion laid it in ruins. It was now no more than a wretched hamlet,
although in local usage it had retained the name of Wang-Li-Fu, the
last syllable of which signified a chief city of a province.

“I say, this is interesting,” exclaimed Inspector Burke. “I am inclined
to think that you and I have picked up a warm scent, Captain O’Shea.
And here’s another bit of paper we can manage to read.”

They pored over a muddy page of McDougal’s diary and discovered, alas!
that it was no more than a fragment of a little Chinese farce called
“The Mender of Broken China-ware.” McDougal had picked it up from some
troupe of strolling players and jotted down a rough translation of his
own, beginning:

      “Seeking a livelihood by the work of my hands,
      Daily do I traverse the streets of the city.
        Well, here I am, a mender of broken jars,
      An unfortunate victim of ever-changing plans.
        To repair fractured jars is my sole occupation.
        ’Tis even so. Disconsolate am I, Niu-Chau.”

The two investigators laid this page aside and scanned the remaining
scraps of paper. The Chinese writing consisted almost wholly of
quotations, lines from the classics, racy proverbs of the common
people, and so on. They contained nothing whatever that might throw
more light on the mystery of McDougal. In much the same way, what he
had written in English concerned itself with his wanderings from port
to port and his pitiful failures to hold a position.

“What we want most was lost in the scuffle,” said O’Shea. “The earlier
part of this diary may have told the story that you and I are anxious
to know.”

“I fancy we know more than any other two white men in China,” drawled
Inspector Burke. “If a chap is really keen to find out something
about this blackguardly organization, he will make a voyage to the
River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells and go pokin’ about the ruined town
of Wang-Li-Fu. It’s out of my bailiwick. Now, whether I ought to
lay this information before the Chinese officials of the provincial
government----”

“Excuse me for meddling,” O’Shea broke in with a boyish, eager smile,
“but I have come a long way to go rummagin’ about in this mess on me
own hook. And do ye think the Chinese government could be trusted to go
ahead and accomplish anything at all? This evidence of ours is no more
than guesswork.”

“I have thought of that, Captain O’Shea. And the thing would not be
done quietly. There would be a lot of chin-chin and clumsy preparation,
and a gun-boat and pig-tailed soldiers, and Shanghai getting wind of
the expedition. It would be better to do the trick off one’s own bat.”

“My friend, the sailorman with the cracked top, remarked most emphatic
about the ‘Head Devil’ when he was spillin’ disconnected language,”
thoughtfully observed O’Shea. “’Tis me strong opinion that he tangled
himself with the main works of this busy fraternity of man-killers.”

“What are your plans, may I ask? You are welcome to all the information
my men may pick up in the native city. What a lark! I wish I might get
a leave of absence and go with you.”

“I would ask no better partner,” warmly returned O’Shea. “Well, I will
buy charts and study the coast of this Kiangsu province and learn what
I can about the inland waters. And then I will find a few good men that
will go to hell for wages, and fight for the love of it. And I will
charter a steamer that is fit to navigate rivers and we will be what
you might call an expedition.”

Inspector Burke gripped the hard hand of Captain O’Shea and exclaimed
with a laugh:

“Here’s luck to you! My word, but you’re the most refreshin’ man
I’ve met since I came off frontier service in India! I will help you
find your men. Nothing easier. Shanghai can furnish you gentlemanly
remittance men from England, stranded American soldiers from Manila,
time-expired bluejackets from Hong-Kong, broken shipmasters from God
knows where, and assorted scamps who will follow any one that will buy
the drinks.”

“’Tis cheerful news, Inspector Burke. I will have a council of war
with you to-morrow at this time. I wish that you would see that poor
McDougal is buried decent in a Christian church-yard and I will be glad
to pay the bills. He was a good man once.”


IV

That same evening Captain O’Shea remained in his room at the hotel
until after nine o’clock. For one thing, he wrote a long letter to
Johnny Kent, acquainting that doughty farmer with the encouraging
progress of the enterprise, which promised “to deal out enough trouble
to satisfy any reasonable man.” Then he took his letter of credit from
the leather bill-book and made sundry calculations. After leaving
Inspector Burke he had rambled along the water-front and made random
inquiries concerning charter prices. Freights were low and the river
trade was dull. His funds could stand the strain. Fighting men of the
kind he wanted were cheap and he would ship coolies as stokers and
deck-hands. However, O’Shea was ready to see the thing through if it
took his last penny. What man with blood in him wouldn’t be glad to pay
the price of such a picnic as this?

Having jotted down his estimates of the cost of coal, stores, wages,
arms, and so on, he cocked an eye at the total and said to himself:

“’Tis the first time I ever backed an expedition of me own, and was not
pulling some one else’s irons out of the fire. I feel like the minister
of war of a revolutionary government.”

Gathering up his papers, he was about to restore them to the leather
wallet when he caught sight of the folded sheet containing the great
Chinese character which he had displayed to Inspector Burke. It was
not a thing to be carried about carelessly and perhaps exposed to
view in the course of his business dealings with banks or shops or
shipping agents. Some association with this sinister symbol had cost
poor McDougal his life. And Chinese were to be found everywhere in the
European settlement. With an unusually prudent impulse, Captain O’Shea
thrust the folded paper between the layers of clothing in his trunk and
put the key in his pocket.

The night was young, the air warm and close within doors, and he
felt not in the least like turning in. Strolling through the wide
corridors, he passed into the street and moved idly in the direction
of the Bund, attracted by the music of a band which was playing in
the park near by. The place was like a lovely garden with wide areas
of lawn and a profusion of foliage. The large number of men and women
who walked to and fro or chatted in groups were, for the most part,
English, American, and German; exiles of a fashionable and prosperous
air who appeared to find life in the Far East quite endurable and
success in their commercial enterprises not harassingly difficult.

Captain O’Shea found a seat on a rustic bench and watched the passing
show. Presently he smiled as he descried the incongruous figure of a
wizened little elderly Irishman in a black frock-coat with a rusty tall
hat firmly jammed on the back of his head. In this smart company Paddy
Blake was a fish out of water, but he had lost not a bit of his brisk,
devil-may-care demeanor which dared any one to tread on the tail of the
coat aforesaid. O’Shea hailed him, and he halted to cackle cordially:

“I was lookin’ for ye to drop into me place all day. There was a magnum
on ice and a brace of cold roast Chinese pheasants that ’ud make a king
lick his chops. I had something important to impart to ye in th’ back
room.”

“’Twas about McDougal, no doubt,” said O’Shea. “I found him, and dead
as a mackerel he was.”

“I had the same news this mornin’,” exclaimed Paddy Blake. “One of me
Chinese bar-boys lives in the native city forninst the French Gate. He
was bound home last night whin the body was found, but the likes of him
’ud scuttle away and say nawthin’ to the police.”

“Inspector Burke tells me that you were not too free with information
yourself,” dryly observed O’Shea.

Paddy Blake vehemently thumped his knee with his tall hat and returned:

“Me place has a bad enough reputation, God knows, and the damned
British police is biassed agin me. Would it do me anny good to be
dragged into court as witness in a murder case and th’ inspector makin’
out that the man got drunk on my booze? Which is wrong entirely, for
McDougal was sober when he went off in tow of Captain Spreckels, as ye
well know. But ’tis no use holdin’ post-mortems. Thim Chinese divils
done for McDougal same as he was afraid of. And are ye makin’ anny
headway in the matter of the big red-headed man that I informed ye was
Jim Eldridge, mate of the _Tai Yan_ steamer?”

“I will not find easy weather of it without McDougal,” said O’Shea, who
had no intention of showing his hand to Paddy Blake.

An electric lamp illuminated the path in front of them, but a large
tree cast a shadow past one end of the bench, which was why they did
not sooner perceive a young man who stood scanning the crowd as if he
had nothing more to do than listen to the music. Now he stepped into
the light and was about to move on when he caught sight of the tall
hat of old Paddy Blake. As though recognizing this ancient landmark,
he made a mock pass at it with his lacquered stick and exclaimed in
accents easily familiar:

“Hello, old sport! I was betting you the price of a new hat on the
arrival of the German mail-boat last week. You won, Paddy, but why do
you not wear the new hat?”

O’Shea was surveying the jocular young man with considerable interest.
Here was a type new to him--the dapper, _blasé_, slangy Chinese of
Shanghai, wearing European clothes and manners, ardent patron of the
club and the race-track, and forsaking his countrymen to live in a
foreign-built villa on the Bubbling Well Road. An English tailor
and an English haberdasher had adorned this young man regardless of
expense, but O’Shea surmised that he was something more than a gilded
rounder. He looked quick-witted and efficient and very wise in worldly
knowledge. Moreover, there was an odd quality of respect in the manner
of the unterrified Paddy Blake as he replied to the greeting.

“An’ what’s the good worrd, Charley? Can I do annything at all for ye?
I am waitin’ to buy a hat with your money whin this one wears out. ’Tis
a shame to toss it away. I want ye to know Captain O’Shea, a seafarin’
friend of mine from New York. Captain, this is Misther Charley Tong
Sin, comprador for Jordan, Margetson & Co., an’ the smartest comprador
that ye will find between Tientsin and Singapore, if I do say it to his
face.”

O’Shea shook hands with the affable young man, who laughed and retorted:

“Paddy is a great chap for the blarney, a first-chop jollier, you bet.
We do some business together when my firm wants sailors for its ships.
Sometimes Paddy beats me; not so often I skin him.”

“Listen to him,” chuckled the old man. “If iver I got the best of him
just once, it ’ud make me too proud to live with. Well, I must be
trottin’ along to me own dump. I wandered to th’ park on the chance of
pickin’ up a couple of stray sailors. If ye can be of anny service to
Captain O’Shea I will count it as a favor, Charley. He’s a stranger and
he’s Irish, and he has made a hit with me.”

Paddy Blake departed in great haste, and Charley Tong Sin offered
O’Shea a cigarette from an ornately jewelled case, remarking:

“You are in Shanghai for business or pleasure? It is a bully good town
for fun; not as swift as New York, but not so slow either. I went to
college in America.”

“Which is more than I did,” confessed O’Shea. “Oh, I am just looking
about Shanghai, not to find out how swift the town is, but to invest a
bit of money, maybe. Jordan, Margetson? That is a big shipping house?”

“The same. I am in charge of the native business,” chirruped Charley
Tong Sin. “Anything in the shipping line you want, you come to see me
and I will put you wise. You have done business in these ports before,
captain?”

“No; mostly in the Atlantic trade. I was in the office of your firm
this afternoon, asking some information about a possible charter.”

“Ah, but you did not see me. Too bad,” and the comprador added with
bland self-satisfaction: “It must have been after three o’clock. Then
I am in the club drinking gin cocktails every day until I go home to
dinner. It is my custom. There is no man in Shanghai that does more
business and drinks more gin cocktails, but I do not mix the two
things. I am the wise guy, eh? What tonnage do you want to charter, and
where to?”

“I am not quite ready to say,” replied O’Shea, who preferred to keep
his affairs to himself even when offered the assistance of so capable
an adviser as Charley Tong Sin.

“I beg your pardon. Come to my office when you have made up your mind,
Captain O’Shea. For the sake of the jolly sprees I had in little old
New York, I will see that you are not stung in Shanghai. What do you
say to a drive on the Bubbling Well Road before you go back to your
hotel? My carriage is waiting a little way from here. I came to the
park to meet a friend but he has not arrived.”

The invitation was attractive and the acquaintance of the comprador
worth cultivating. O’Shea accepted with thanks, and presently they
climbed into a very shiny victoria with two Chinese grooms on the box.
The spirited little horses, admirably matched, danced through the
paved streets of the settlement and out into the wider spaces of the
countryside. The shipmaster found pleasure in new places; with him
sight-seeing had never lost its zest, and the Bubbling Well Road was
one of the things that no voyager to the Orient ought to miss. To view
it by night was rather unsatisfactory, but the air was deliciously
sweet and cool, and the handsome embowered residences of merchants and
diplomats and Chinese officials appeared quite magnificent when duskily
discerned by the glimmer of the stars.

“You have seen the native city? No?” said Charley Tong Sin. “It is
very dirty, but picturesque to beat the deuce. What you say? To-morrow
morning I go to have an appointment with His Excellency, the governor,
at his yamen. It is on business. Perhaps you would like to meet me
there and have an audience. It is rather good fun, much red-tape, a big
bunch of officials, and plenty of kow-towing. Not many foreigners have
admittance to him in this way.”

It occurred to Captain O’Shea that he should very much like to learn
what the government of the native city, or the police department
thereof, had discovered in connection with the murder of McDougal.
And to gain an entrance in company with the influential comprador,
himself a Chinese, was to make his inquiries under the most favorable
circumstances.

“I will jump at the chance,” he exclaimed. “A man like me that may do
business in China in a small way should make himself solid with the
powers that be.”

“I am sorry that I cannot meet you at your hotel and take you to the
yamen,” explained Charley Tong Sin, “but to-morrow I must be very
early at my office to make up the accounts of a ship that will sail
for Hankow, and then I will have to hurry into the native city like
the very devil. If you tell your ’rickshaw man to carry you to the
governor’s yamen I will be there and see you at eight o’clock.”

“I can find my way, and many thanks to you,” cordially returned O’Shea.
“The native city is strange water, but no doubt the ’rickshaw pilot
will know his course.”

It was drawing near to midnight when the shiny victoria left Captain
O’Shea at the Astor House and the obliging Charley Tong Sin bade him
adieu. The shipmaster went yawning to his room, agreeably refreshed by
the outing and ready for bed. He was a tidy man by habit, having stowed
himself and his belongings for much of his life in a space no larger
than a respectable closet. Even in a hotel room he left nothing strewn
about.

He had no more than pulled off his coat when he observed that things
were not arranged exactly as he had left them. His eyes noted one
trifle, and this led him to look for others. The Chinese servant had
been in to turn down the bed, leave fresh towels, and pick up burnt
matches and scraps of paper, but something other than this routine
handwork had been busy in the room. His things had been examined
hastily, but with careful endeavor to leave them as they were. Opening
one bureau drawer after another, he found confirmation of this
suspicion. The articles therein had been not so much poked about in
disorder as moved from their places by exploring hands.

If a thief had been in the room he found no booty for his pains, for
there was neither money nor jewelry to be looted. Captain O’Shea
thoughtfully picked up a leather hand-bag which was locked as he had
left it. Inserting the key he looked inside. He had been careful to
slip a box of revolver cartridges into a leather flap-pocket because
the pasteboard covering was broken and they were apt to spill loose
in the bottom of the bag. Evidently it had been ransacked, for the
box of cartridges was not in the pocket, but lodged in a fold of a
rain-coat which half filled the bag. O’Shea whistled softly and moved
straightway to his trunk. This also was locked. Flinging back the lid,
he instantly searched between the layers of clothing for the folded
sheet of heavy paper on which he had drawn with a brush and stencilling
ink the ominous Chinese character that was branded into the back of the
red-haired sailor-man.

The paper was missing. Something had already told him that he should
find it missing. He made no further search, but sat himself down on the
edge of the bed and stared very hard at the blank wall. The night was
as warm as before, but he felt curiously chilly.

“’Tis like as if some one had jammed an icicle into the small of me
back,” he reflected. “I will not cry before I am hurt, but there’s
more to this divertin’ adventure of mine than Johnny Kent and I ever
dreamed of on the farm.”

Certain conclusions were boldly obvious. His real business in China
had been discovered by the same agency which had tried to slay the
red-haired sailor and which had murdered McDougal. The paper had been
stolen because it was a clinching proof of his active interest and
interference, and perhaps also to terrify and intimidate him with the
realization that intelligences, hostile and secret, were spying on him.
It was futile to try to guess how the knowledge of his purpose had
been disclosed. McDougal may have been watched and followed, as O’Shea
had already surmised, and they had been seen talking together in Paddy
Blake’s place. Some listener may have been unseen during the interview
at the headquarters of Inspector Burke.

To make complaint, either to the hotel management or to the police,
that his room had been entered seemed a silly proceeding. To catch this
kind of a thief was as hopeless as chasing a phantom. It was decidedly
unpleasant to think of going to sleep in this room, for as Captain
Michael O’Shea admitted to himself, with a very serious countenance:

“The lad that did that trick is likely to sift in through the key-hole
if he takes the notion and chop the brand into me back after slippin’
the knife into me before I can wake up to find out how dead I am. I
would like to sleep in the same bed with Inspector Burke and a battery
of the Royal Artillery this night, but if I lose me nerve Johnny Kent
will disown me entirely.”

With this he looked over his defences, like a seasoned campaigner,
and assembled the chairs, the crockery, and the large tin bath-tub,
together with the heavier articles of his own kit. Two chairs he
placed against the door, one balanced on top of the other so that if
dislodged they would topple over with a good deal of noise. The cord
of the mosquito canopy he cut in twain, and so ingeniously suspended
tub and crockery just inside the two windows that the wariest intruder
must certainly set in motion a clamorous little avalanche. Then, having
tucked his revolver under the pillow, he prudently commended his soul
to his Maker and composed himself to slumber of a hair-trigger kind.

The night passed without alarm and Captain Michael O’Shea roused
himself out soon after daybreak to smoke three strong Manila cigars
and organize himself as a strategy board, or one might have said that
he was clearing for action. Convinced that the game he played was
a genuinely dangerous one, he was in haste to get afloat where he
belonged. To dodge the wiles of an ambushed foe was not what he liked.
At this kind of warfare the Chinese mind was too nimble for him.

He decided that he would keep the appointment to meet Charley Tong
Sin at the yamen of the governor of the native city. No mischance was
likely to befall him in broad daylight, and, given the opportunity,
he would seek a private interview with that official. This business
despatched, he proposed to show the water-front of Shanghai how
speedily a river steamer could be manned and taken to sea.

Having eaten breakfast early and with good appetite, Captain O’Shea
went out to find a ’rickshaw. Only one of them happened to be standing
in front of the hotel and he had little trouble in making the swarthy,
sturdy fellow in the shafts understand where he wished to go. The
coolie set off at a racing trot, whisking the vehicle along with
amazing ease. The passenger had not outgrown the idea that it was
rather absurd and unfair for an able-bodied person to be pulled along
in this fashion by another man no stronger than himself. Therefore,
he nodded approval when the coolie slackened his gait and yelled at
another stalwart Chinese squatted on the curbstone who picked himself
up and ran behind the ’rickshaw as “push-man,” making a double team of
it.

Moved by two-man power, the light vehicle made a speedy passage through
the British settlement and turned into the French quarter to reach
the nearest gate-way of the native city wall. Soon the order and
cleanliness and modernity of European territory and dominion were left
behind and the ’rickshaw had spun into the swarming, filthy streets of
the immemorial China.

“The River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells can be no worse than this,” said
O’Shea to himself, “and for the love of heaven was there ever such a
mess of people jumbled together?”

No more than eight or ten feet wide, the alleys were crowded with
pedlers and street-merchants selling cakes, fish, pork, vegetables,
porcelain, furs, embroideries, pictures, bamboo pipes, their wares
displayed on little wooden stands or spread upon the rutted flag-stones.

Jostling among them were laden mules, top-heavy wheelbarrows, bawling
coolies sweating beneath the burden of the shoulder-yokes, hordes
of idlers, screaming children, until it was to wonder why traffic
was not wholly blockaded. Into this ruck of humanity, this immense
confusion and noise, the two ’rickshaw men hurled their vehicle like
a projectile. They shouted incessantly, threatening and reviling, nor
tried to pick a way through the press. These who got in their path were
knocked head over heels. Pedlers’ barrows were upset helter-skelter.
The onward course of Captain O’Shea was as destructive as a typhoon.

He yelled at his headlong chargers to slow down. They were likely to
cause a riot. Already a mob was buzzing angrily in their wake and
several missiles were hurled at the ’rickshaw. Captain O’Shea had
the sensations of a man who was being run away with. This brace of
pig-tailed fiends had bolted hell-for-leather. He was of a mind to jump
out and let them go their own gait, but this enlarged baby-carriage
of a ’rickshaw was awkward to disembark from while under way, and he
was reluctant to risk landing upon his head. If he menaced them with
a revolver the mob would be apt to join forces with them against the
foreigner. Still, this might be the peculiar fashion of conveying a
gentleman to the governor’s yamen, and perhaps he had better sit tight
and hold hard until the ship struck a rock.

Presently, however, he observed that several big swarthy men in blue
cotton blouses were running alongside the coolie in the shafts and
holding shouted converse with him. They appeared to be friends of his,
and Captain O’Shea did not like their looks. They were hardier, more
truculent of visage, than the pasty-faced Shanghai coolie class. The
tough has the same ear-marks the world over, and these fellows were
ruffians whom one would not care to meet in the dark.

A few minutes after these had joined company the ’rickshaw turned
abruptly from one of the crowded streets and moved with undiminished
speed into a wider but much less frequented thoroughfare lined with
stables, straw-littered court-yards whose buildings were in ruinous
decay, and hovels used as slaughter-houses where mangy dogs prowled
in search of offal. The ’rickshaw tilted and veered sharply in the
direction of one of these disreputable court-yards, and Captain Michael
O’Shea, quite certain that he was not headed toward the governor’s
yamen, acted decisively and on the spur of the moment.

Things were going all wrong and very probably he would alight from the
frying-pan into the fire, but this was nothing less than an abduction.
The coolie in the shafts had coiled his queue under his cap, possibly
to guard against the very manœuvre that O’Shea executed. But the wind
and the rapid motion had loosed the end of the thick black braid and it
bobbed between his shoulders and whipped free as he ran.

Bending forward, O’Shea clutched the queue in a tremendous grip and
laid back as if he were hauling on a main-sheet. The rascal’s head
was fetched up with a dislocating jerk, his feet pawed the air for an
instant, and his hands lost their hold of the shafts. Then, as he came
down and tried vainly to get a footing, the careering ’rickshaw rammed
him from behind and sent him sprawling on his face. Shot out from his
seat went Captain O’Shea, his feet in front of him, a revolver in his
fist, ready to bound up from the pavement and open the engagement on
the instant.

The “push-man” had been violently poked under the chin by the back
of the suddenly halted ’rickshaw, and he lay groaning and doubled
up several feet away. The ruffianly escort, taken by surprise, ran
a little distance before they could wheel and return to the scene.
Captain O’Shea had a moment in which to get his bearings and take
stock of the situation. Darting for the nearest wall, he braced his
back against it and stood waiting. The big swarthy rascals in the
blue blouses fiercely jabbered together, gazed up and down the almost
deserted street, and with no more delay drew knives from their baggy
breeches and charged with heads down.

O’Shea threw up his revolver for a snap-shot at the foremost of them.
The hammer clicked. There was no report. He pulled the trigger again
with the same result. For the third time the hammer fell with the same
futile, sickening click. This was his finish. The thing was absurd,
incredible. Raging, he grasped the weapon by the barrel and ran
forward to swing the butt against the nearest shaven head. A long knife
ripped at him and slashed his sleeve. He cracked the man’s head, but
the others were at him like wolves. He dodged and tried to take to his
heels, but the two ’rickshaw men blocked his path.

One of the assassins had worked around behind him and was trying to
trip and get him down so that they could cut him to ribbons at their
leisure. The knives hemmed him in. He slipped and fell upon one knee.
The ruffians laughed.

Then, lo and behold! they were scampering frantically away, yelling in
fear, scrambling over walls like monkeys, diving into the stables and
court-yards, flying for the lower end of the street. In a twinkling
Captain O’Shea was alone, magically snatched from death. White and
shaking, he stood and gazed at a near-by corner of the crooked
thoroughfare. Filing past it came a squad of British bluejackets in
white clothes, and the sun winked brightly on the polished metal of
their rifles and cutlasses. Beside the lieutenant, in front of them,
strode a tall, slim-waisted man in khaki uniform whom O’Shea recognized
as Inspector Burke. O’Shea’s assailants had been warned in time to
scurry to cover before the British party had more than a flying glimpse
of them. At a quick order shouted by the lieutenant, the sailors
scattered into the yards and squalid buildings, but the fugitives had
escaped by a dozen dark and devious exits to vanish in the labyrinths
of the teeming, mysterious native city. Inspector Burke was pounding
O’Shea on the back and exclaiming vigorously:

“My word, old chap! What sort of a bally row is this? The beggars
nearly did for you. Lucky we happened along, wasn’t it?”

“Tis all of that,” earnestly replied the shipmaster. “And who are ye,
anyhow? Is this a fairy story or a play right out of the theatre? You
came on the stage about one second before the curtain rung down.”

“Leftenant Kempton-Shaw--ah, here he is--allow me to present him,
Captain O’Shea--as I was about to say, he came ashore from the
_Warspite_ gun-boat this mornin’ with a batch of Chinese pirates, the
real thing, don’t you know. He took them out of a junk after a rather
nice little shindy last week. He marched them to the Chinese prison
just now, it’s in this quarter of the native city, and their heads will
be cut off to-morrow. I’m awfully pleased that we were taking this
short cut home. In close quarters, weren’t you?”

“I have never found them a closer fit,” said O’Shea. “I was on me way
for a chat with the governor, and a gang of bad citizens tried to wipe
me out. I will walk along with you if ye don’t mind. There is enough
Irish in me to waste no great love on the British flag, but I will say,
Lieutenant Kempton-Shaw, that I never laid eyes on a finer, handsomer
lot of men than these lads of yours from the _Warspite_.”

“Thanks, and I fancy you mean it,” smiled the naval officer. “This is
extraordinary, by Jove. Foreigners are fairly safe in the native city,
as a rule, are they not, Burke? What do you make of it?”

“I shall have to hear Captain O’Shea’s report.”

“I have no long-winded report to offer,” incisively declared the
shipmaster. “I have me suspicions, and you can guess what they are,
Inspector Burke. ’Tis the same business that we talked about in your
office. But I wish nothing to do with any police investigations. You
will report this row of mine to the native government, I have no doubt,
and I hope ye will try to collect an indemnity for me distressed
emotions, but I have no time to dilly-dally about in Shanghai. I will
go to sea. Will you help me find the men?”

“From the tone of your voice I infer that your business is not
precisely pacific, my dear sir,” put in Lieutenant Kempton-Shaw. “Do
you mind letting the _Warspites_ in on this cruise of yours?”

“Thank you, but I have set out to handle it as an affair of me own.
I may have bit off more than I can chew, but I will try to see it
through.”

“Meet me at my office at noon and I’ll have some men for you to look
over,” said Inspector Burke. “I will pick up a crew for you if I have
to make a general jail-delivery.”

As they trudged along Captain O’Shea became silent and abstracted. He
was not in a mood for conversation. Conjecture pointed one way. He had
been a gullible fool who deserved to have a knife stuck in his ribs. It
had been as easy to trap him as though he were a lubber on his first
voyage out from home. It had been with design that only one ’rickshaw
stood in front of the hotel that morning when he was ready to go to
the native city. And the pair of coolies were hired cutthroats who had
steered him into the disgusting street among the slaughter-houses in
order that he might be done away with, leaving never a trace of his
fate behind him.

Reasoning back from this link to the next preceding, his room had
been entered and ransacked while he was safely out of the way in a
carriage on the Bubbling Well Road. Some time had been required to
make that careful examination and fit keys to his hand-bag and trunk.
Also, he had just now investigated his revolver and discovered that
the firing-pin of the hammer had been filed, not enough for the eye to
notice it, but sufficiently to cause the impact to fail to explode the
primer of the cartridge.

The affable, gilded young gentleman who had invited him to drive on the
Bubbling Well Road was the same kind acquaintance who had suggested
that he take a ’rickshaw and visit the native city in the morning. The
finger of coincidence pointed in the direction of that smartest of
compradores, Charley Tong Sin.

“That kind of coincidence is unhealthier than the cholera,” said O’Shea
to himself. “Maybe this sport with the college education and the taste
for gin cocktails is a good friend of mine, but I will give him no
chance to prove it again. I have been on the jump ever since I met him.
If he is not crooked he is a hoodoo. And ’tis not impossible, after
all, that he is mixed up with this gang of murderers that I am running
after. The heart of him is Chinese.”

He would keep these suspicions to himself. They lacked tangible proof,
and he held to the view that the business was entirely his own. He
had plunged into this befogged maze of circumstances like a boy on a
holiday, and it was for him to extricate himself like a man. With the
warmest expressions of gratitude he parted from Inspector Burke and the
naval lieutenant, and hastened in the direction of the water-front.

Less than an hour later he was inspecting a light-draught steamer
called the _Whang Ho_ owned by the China Navigation Company. She was
old, sadly in need of repairs, and about as sea-worthy for rough
weather as a packing-box. But O’Shea felt confident that she could
be nursed along to serve his purpose, and the larger, better vessels
available for charter at short notice were not so handy for exploring
muddy rivers and strange corners. Having put to sea at one time and
another in craft which were held together only by their paint, Captain
O’Shea asked no more of the _Whang Ho_ than that her engines should
turn over. He dared not examine the machinery too closely lest he might
lose confidence in his steamer, but the owners’ agent assured him that
she was fit for service and he took his word for it.

“Start her fires going at once,” said O’Shea, “and if enough pressure
shows on the gauges to turn her wheel as she lies at her moorings, I
will sign the charter-party and insurance papers and slap down the two
thousand dollars for a month’s use of the venerable relic.”

“That is fair enough,” replied the agent. “And it is as good as done.
You can go ahead with getting your supplies, Captain O’Shea. I take it
that you want to do a bit of exploration work for one of the American
syndicates? We have done quite a lot of business with your people and
their concessions.”

“It may be something like that,” briefly returned O’Shea. “And now will
you be kind enough to tell me where to order a hundred and fifty tons
of steam coal to be put in the bunkers this very day?”

“Our company will be pleased to let you have it, and I can guarantee
prompt delivery from lighters alongside the steamer. Or I presume that
Jordan, Margetson will do the same for you.”

“I think I will not deal with Jordan, Margetson,” and O’Shea’s voice
was smooth and pleasant. “The comprador is a very able young man.”

“Charley Tong Sin? Well, rather. A smart chap, that.”

“Yes, very. I wish I could keep my razor as sharp.”

Captain O’Shea next visited a ship-chandler’s and submitted his list of
stores, making it a condition of payment that the stuff should be in
the steamer before sunset. The elderly German who served him had the
tact and discretion bred of long experience with the seafarers of the
unexpected Orient. It was his business to sell them whatever they might
want, to take his profit and ask no questions. Yes, he could find
thirty service rifles and revolvers, also cutlasses of the best steel.
They were of patterns discarded by a certain European government, but
excellent weapons. He would be glad to sell the captain one, five,
or ten thousand of them. The captain was not a man to wag a foolish
tongue; one could see it at a glance.

“You and I might do business some day,” quoth O’Shea, “but I am too
busy to start a revolution at present.”

He sent a note to Paddy Blake asking him to find a dozen Chinese
firemen and sailors and a river pilot, and to muster them ready for
signing articles in the afternoon. He believed the old Irishman to be a
ripened scoundrel at his own trade, but suspected him of no complicity
in the manœuvres of Charley Tong Sin. The comprador had merely used
Paddy Blake as a means of making the acquaintance of Captain O’Shea.

Five minutes after noon the shipmaster (he had taken a decided dislike
to riding in ’rickshaws) trudged into the headquarters building of
Inspector Burke.

“I have a choice collection for you to look over,” said the latter.
“They are waiting in another room, and I should call them a worried
lot. I sent my men out to pick them up, do you see, and they have not
been told the reason why.”

“I cannot afford to be particular, Inspector Burke. Let me at them and
I will see whether I am safer ashore among the Chinese or at sea with
your exhibit of beach-combers.”

“Oh, they are not as bad as that,” the inspector assured him. “I
should scarcely call them desperate characters. However, while I wish
you the best of luck, old chap, I shall shed never a tear if you lose
your shipmates somewhere beyond Shanghai. Let us call them soldiers of
misfortune, if you like.”

He led the way into the large drill-room, where a score or more of men
stood in uneasy attitudes and appeared not at all comfortable in this
environment. O’Shea let his glance rove in swift, appraising scrutiny
and smiled to himself as he recognized one familiar type after another.
He had recruited such men as these for unostentatious ventures in the
waters of the Spanish Main. Here was the red-faced, burly shipmaster
ready with a glib speech and fluent curses to explain how he happened
to be without his papers; the shambling ne’er-do-well with the slack
mouth and the weak chin who had fled from a scrape at home to lose
himself in foreign ports; the tanned adventurer, brave and resourceful,
who was fit for nothing else than the life of a rover; the battered old
seaman, worn out by the hardships of the forecastle, who had been cast
adrift from the hospital; the cashiered army officer with the hall-mark
of his caste blurred but still visible; the sharp-featured young man
with the furtive eye who lived by his wits and found it very hard
living indeed; the bleary tropical tramp who would sell his soul for a
drink of brandy.

These and the rest of them were seedy in various ways. They conveyed
a sense of failure, of having lost their grip. Their clothes did not
signify this so much as what life had written in their faces. Several,
in fact, were dressed in clean white duck and linen. They were fighting
hard to preserve the guise of self-respect. And yet every man of them
had marched to police headquarters at a word from Inspector Burke with
the sick fear in his heart that his past had overtaken him, or that he
was to be deported for the good of the community, or that he was to be
locked up as a vagrant.

Inspector Burke felt pity for them. It was heartless to keep the poor
devils in this painful suspense. With a curt nod he addressed them in
a group, for they had unwittingly drifted together as if finding some
small comfort in solidarity.

“This is not police business,” said he. “I sent for you to oblige my
friend Captain O’Shea. He will explain what he wants, and I advise you
to play square with him and I’m quite sure he will make it worth while.”

At this the company brightened and looked immensely relieved. The
hang-dog manner fled. Shoulders were braced, heads held erect. They
were like different men. O’Shea had a less pessimistic opinion of
them. He had already concluded to show no finicky taste by picking and
choosing. He would take them in a lump, good, bad, and indifferent.
Those who were really competent would soon disclose it on shipboard and
they could help him hammer the others into shape.

“My speech to you will be short and sweet,” said he. “I need men for
a voyage coastwise and me steamer will be ready to sail to-night. You
will live well and I expect ye to obey orders. ’Tis not sailors’ work
or I should not take on your kind. The fewer questions ye ask the more
popular ye will be with me. The pay will be at the rate of five dollars
a day gold, but I will give no advances. I want ye to come aboard
sober. If you handle yourselves like men I will pay ye a bonus at the
end of the voyage. Those that want to go will give me their names.”

Not a man hung back or asked a question. They whispered softly among
themselves, as if afraid to make a slip that might break the spell.
Captain O’Shea had one thing more to say and they listened with the
most devout attention.

“I took note of the small Hotel London down by the water-side. ’Tis a
clean, decent place and I have had a word with the landlord. I will
give every man me card. If you show it to him he will be pleased to
entertain ye at dinner at once, and he will hand ye out cigars and
three drinks apiece, no more. And I will meet you there for supper at
six o’clock to-night.”

“Excellent strategy,” murmured Inspector Burke.

“By the way,” cried O’Shea to his pleased followers, “I overlooked
something. I need a chief engineer. Can any one of you qualify?”

It appeared that none of them was sufficiently acquainted with the
internal works of a steamer to pass as an expert, although a young man
of a very Cockney accent thought he might do as an assistant.

Inspector Burke made haste to remark:

“I say, let me give you the very man for the job. Kittridge is his
name. It’s rather awkward, for he is in clink at present, the British
jail. But his time expires to-morrow--he was given thirty days--and I
dare say the magistrate will be willing to sign release papers if I
explain the situation.”

“I am not asking me men for references,” observed O’Shea, “but, as a
matter of mild curiosity, what did ye put this Kittridge away for?”

“He tried to whip my entire Sikh police force, and he made a jolly
good beginning. Then his ship sailed away and left him in quod. He was
engineer in a Cardiff tramp. A very good man, I understand.”

“He sounds like it. His references are most satisfactory, especially
what he did to your turbanned cops,” O’Shea cordially affirmed. “Send
this Kittridge to the Hotel London, if ye please, and give him this
card of mine, and tell him to wait for me there.”

Through the afternoon Captain Michael O’Shea, now master of the aged
river steamer _Whang Ho_, was the busiest and most energetic of men. A
hundred and one things presented themselves as necessary to be done.
When at length he hurried into the Hotel London shortly before the
supper-hour his men were waiting, hopeful, expectant, cheerful, smoking
his cigars and with the three drinks apiece tucked under their belts.
Among them was a lanky, solemn person with a pair of gray side-whiskers
and a leathery complexion crisscrossed by a net-work of fine wrinkles.
His whole appearance was eminently decorous and respectable and he
seemed to have strayed into the wrong company. It was not far-fetched
to conjecture that he might be a missionary from some station in the
Chinese hinterland who had kindly concerned himself with the souls of
this congregation of black sheep.

Captain O’Shea bowed to him with a puzzled, respectful air, at which
the pious stranger remarked:

“Inspector Burke told me to report here and be damn quick about it. I
am Kittridge, and I hear you are wanting an engineer.”

“Excuse me, Mr. Kittridge. I came near mistakin’ you for a sky-pilot.
And so your favorite pastime is beating up Sikh policemen! I have a job
for ye at double the wages you got in your tramp steamer, whatever they
were. Are you willing?”

“I would sign on with the devil himself to get clear of this
blankety-blank pig-hole of a blistering Shanghai,” promptly exclaimed
Mr. Kittridge. “Where’s your ship? Shall I go aboard at once?”

“Please take a look at the engine-room and report to me here. She is
the _Whang Ho_, tied up at the China Navigation Company’s wharf. Don’t
be too critical, but if there’s work that is absolutely necessary I
will send ye machinists to work all night.”

“I know the condemned little hooker by sight,” bitterly quoth Mr.
Kittridge with a tug at his starboard whisker. “Very well, sir. I will
take a squint at her and make out my list of engine-room stores. Can
you get them to-night?”

“The ship-chandler is waiting to hear from me, and I have sent word to
the machine-shop,” briefly answered O’Shea.

Paddy Blake had very promptly raked up the required number of Chinese
hands and was ready to deliver them on board whenever required. To the
Hotel London he came, towing by the arm a most extraordinarily bent and
shrivelled anatomy with a wisp of a white queue, whom he turned over to
Captain O’Shea with the explanation:

“Here is a river and coastwise pilot for ye that is as wise as
Confucius. And by the same token, I have no doubt that he was once
pilot aboard the junk of that grand old philosopher himself. Or maybe
he was shipmates with Noah.”

The ancient mariner croaked a phrase or two in a grating, rusty voice,
and O’Shea dubiously observed:

“If he talks no English at all how will I tell him where I want to go?”

“I have sent ye a Chinese bos’n that can sling th’ pidgin,” said Paddy
Blake. “Dearly would I love to know where ye are bound and what bobbery
ye are up to, Captain Mike O’Shea, but a man in my business has learned
to ask no more silly questions than he can help.”

“Keep that magnum on ice till I come back to Shanghai and I will spin
ye the yarn in the little back room of yours, Paddy.”

“May ye come back right side up,” warmly exclaimed the old man. “By
th’ look of the friends ye have mustered to go wid you, I wud say
that ye are bound out on what th’ Shanghai diplomats call a policy of
binivolint assimilation.”

The report of the aggrieved Mr. Kittridge was to the effect that while
the engines of the _Whang Ho_ would probably take her to sea without
breaking down, a night’s work on the condenser, not to mention a leaky
cylinder, would considerably improve her health. Captain O’Shea told
him to drive ahead with these repairs; nor was the delay worth fretting
about. Things had gone amazingly well thus far and the _Whang Ho_ would
be ready to sail in the morning. He had no desire to spend another
night ashore, and he would take his company on board at once, assign
them to quarters, and make a tentative organization for sea duty.

The _Whang Ho_ had been fitted for passenger service on the Yang-tse,
and there were state-rooms on the upper deck to hold twice the number
of O’Shea’s recruits. In the Chinese draft sent aboard by Paddy Blake
were a cook and a steward trained to their business, and they put
things to rights in their quiet, deft way. The mood of Captain O’Shea
became normally cheerful and confident. He had a deck under his feet,
his word was law, and it was good to hear the lap of salt water and the
swirl of the tide against a vessel’s side.

He was awake and about until midnight. The work in the engine-room was
progressing rapidly under the vehement direction of Mr. Kittridge.
Feeling the need of sleep, for the preceding night had been a broken
one, Captain O’Shea set a watch in charge of the burly shipmaster of
his company whom he appointed first mate and went to his bunk in the
cabin just abaft the wheel-house. At three o’clock Mr. Kittridge,
very hot and grimy, rapped on the door and gruffly announced that the
machinists had gone ashore and he proposed to turn in and sleep until
sailing-time.

At six o’clock Captain O’Shea went on deck in his pajamas to order the
steward to fetch him a cup of coffee. He saw no reason why the steamer
should not get under way at once. The Chinese steward came not at his
call and he betook himself to the galley. A fire was burning in the
range, rice and potatoes were cooking in the pots, bacon sliced on the
table ready for frying, but there was no cook. O’Shea looked puzzled
and started for the forecastle. On the way he met his first mate whose
demeanor was distressed and excited.

“I was about to call you, sir,” he exclaimed, his red face working with
emotion. “You will think I’ve made a hash of my first night on duty,
but this insane business happened like a shot out of a gun, sir. Not
ten minutes ago the Chinamen, every last one of ’em, came boiling on
deck and went over the side to the wharf like so many rats. And they
never did stop running. They were scared; it was a panic; but they
didn’t stop to jabber. They just flew, and most of ’em left their
dunnage behind.”

“The divil you say,” muttered O’Shea, and he rubbed his head in
slightly bewildered fashion. “That must have been just before I stepped
on deck, Mr. Parkinson. And ye have no idea at all what it was about?”

“Not the slightest, sir. I hope you don’t blame me. I’d have sailed
into the thick of them with my fists, but it was like chasing so many
greased pigs. They vanished before you could more than wink.”

“What about the fires?” snapped the captain. “Have you been below?”

“Yes, sir. The first thing I did was to find Mr. Kittridge. He is in
the engine-room, and he told me to send down half a dozen of our white
men to keep up steam.”

“Good enough! Now sing out for a volunteer cook, and I will investigate
this comical performance. Did anybody get aboard to talk to these
Chinamen?”

“Not a soul, sir. I’m sure of it. I had a reliable man at the gangway,
and another on the wharf.”

“I believe you. While I look around a bit, get the ship ready to go
to sea, Mr. Parkinson. ’Tis not in me mind to be hung up in port very
long.”

A sailing junk was attempting to reach with the morning breeze across
the wide stretch of river. Hauling close to the wharf at which the
_Whang Ho_ was moored, the junk attempted to come about, but missed
stays in lubberly fashion and hung in the wind as she slowly drifted
past the steamer’s stern. The Chinese who clung to the long tiller,
and the others who stood upon the poop or hauled on the cordage, were
gazing with signs of excitement at the _Whang Ho_. Several of them
gesticulated, and their fingers were aimed at the rounded, overhanging
stern of Captain O’Shea’s vessel. He caught sight of those antics and
walked aft.

There was no good reason why the crew of the passing junk should
make such a fuss over this commonplace river steamer. Their singular
interest in her might be worth trying to fathom. Without delaying to
seek the gangway, he threw his leg around a tautened hawser and slid
down to the wharf. Running out to the end of it, he commanded a clear
view of the stern of the _Whang Ho_. Upon the white woodwork, just
above the counter, was painted in broad strokes of bright vermilion the
sprawling Chinese character which had been gashed in the back of the
sailor named Jim Eldridge.

Captain O’Shea hastily returned on board and climbed over the after
rail, belaying a loose end of heaving-line and resting his foot in the
loop so that he was able to let himself down until he could touch the
uppermost smear of vermilion paint. It rubbed off on his hand, fresh
and wet, and must have been applied during the night. His Chinese crew
had discovered it there. Perhaps some one had sung out the information
from a passing junk or sampan. At any rate, this was what had made them
quit the steamer. A charge of dynamite could have made their exodus
no more expeditious. The word had flown from mouth to mouth, and they
fled from the ship as from the plague. Even the incredibly aged pilot
had hobbled away with the rest of them, fear restoring an agility long
since departed.

“The hoodoo again!” reflectively exclaimed O’Shea. “I thought I had got
clear of it. ’Tis not so much to frighten me this time as to delay the
voyage. Somebody is anxious to send word up the coast ahead of me to
let some one else know I am coming. That is a guess, and ’tis as good
as the next one.”

He would find Paddy Blake at once and discuss the matter with him.
Perhaps he could ship another crew and leave port before the news had
time to spread among the Chinese seafarers. Telling Mr. Parkinson to
see to it that the vermilion paint was instantly removed, he set out
on foot along the water-front. At this early hour, there was no stir
of business among the foreign shipping-houses. Passing a substantial
brick building, Captain O’Shea’s eye was held for an instant by the
brass sign on one of the doors, “Jordan, Margetson & Co.” He happened
to be thinking quite assiduously just then of the courteous comprador,
Charley Tong Sin. He halted and stared hard at the door in front of him
which was ajar.

It was too early for any of the clerks to be about. With an impulse
which had no definite purpose behind it, Captain O’Shea pushed open
the door and quietly stepped into the hallway and thence into the
main office with its row of desks. The room was empty, and he moved
in the direction of the smaller, detached offices in the rear, still
treading softly. Yes, the shrewd and zealous comprador, so faithful to
his employers’ interests, was already at work. When the visitor caught
sight of him he was bending over a table littered with papers, intent
on arranging and filing them. Possibly his ears were as quick as his
wits and he had heard Captain O’Shea before seeing him. Unruffled and
smiling, with an air of delighted surprise, the comprador exclaimed,
advancing with hand outstretched:

“How glad I am to see you again! The top of the morning! Were you
looking to find me? Ah, I am the early bird, you bet.”

“I expected to sail by now, but there has been a bit of trouble with me
native crew,” replied the shipmaster, wary as a hawk. “I saw your place
was open and I dropped in on the chance of bidding ye farewell. You
mentioned the other night that you sometimes came down early.”

“That is the deuce of my business, Captain,” easily returned Charley
Tong Sin. “Trouble with your crew? Can I help you? Do you need men? I
am sorry you didn’t come to me in the first place.”

“I wish I had. ’Twas old Paddy Blake I first turned to as one Irishman
to another. And maybe I was wrong in not asking your advice about the
steamer.”

If this were a fencing-match, then O’Shea had scored the first point.
His bold, ingenuous features expressed not the slightest change of
emotion, but in an instant he had discovered that which clinched
and drove home his suspicions of Charley Tong Sin. The comprador put
a fresh cigarette to his lips and held a lighted match between his
fingers, unaware that the flare conveyed a fleeting translucence.
Underneath the beautifully polished nails of his thumb and forefinger
there showed a line of vermilion which the most careful scrubbing had
failed to eradicate. It was the color of the paint which had been
smeared on the stern of the _Whang Ho_ in the form of a sprawling
Chinese character.

The luck of Captain Michael O’Shea so ordered it that he should observe
this phenomenon before the flare of the match died out. Thereupon he
lied swiftly and plausibly, the purpose hot in his heart to find a
pretext that should coax the comprador to accompany him on board the
_Whang Ho_. To a sympathetic query Captain O’Shea smoothly made answer:

“I am the kind of a man that will own up to his own mistakes. I thought
I could go it alone when I ought to have been glad and thankful for
the help of a man like yourself. Between us, I am not anxious to go to
sea in this old tub that I have chartered from the China Navigation
Company. And now that I am delayed for lack of a crew, maybe you can
show me a way to slip out of the bargain. My chief engineer finds the
vessel is not at all what she was represented to be. I took her subject
to certain conditions and she cannot make good.”

“I told you you would be stung in Shanghai without me,” laughed Charley
Tong Sin in the greatest good-humor. “Better chuck up the _Whang Ho_
and let me find you a steamer.”

“That I will do, and gladly,” affirmed O’Shea. “Have ye time to step
aboard with me now and I will show you how I have been buncoed. Then ye
can advise me how to break the charter. I have a good case.”

“Of course I will,” cried the comprador. “Pooh, we will bluff the China
Navigation Company out of its boots. I will make them look like thirty
cents.”

“You are the smartest comprador between Tientsin and Singapore,
according to Paddy Blake, and I have no doubt of it,” sweetly murmured
Captain O’Shea.

“That’s what everybody says,” affably rejoined Charley Tong Sin as they
walked into the street. “What is the trouble with your crew?”

“You can search me. I cannot find out for the life of me. They up and
jumped ship without warning.”

“I will get more men for you. Leave it to me. You have come to the
right place this time, Captain O’Shea.”

Chatting amiably, the twain came to the wharf and climbed the gangway
of the _Whang Ho_. That anxious first mate, Mr. Parkinson, pitiably
afraid lest he lose his billet and be turned adrift because he had
failed to prevent the desertion of the crew, brightened perceptibly at
sight of Charley Tong Sin and concluded that this influential young man
had been persuaded to mend the troubles.

“Come to my room, if ye please,” said Captain O’Shea to the smiling
comprador, “and I will summon my chief engineer. He will tell you that
the steamer is not fit to make three knots an hour, and then we will go
below.”

The shipmaster beckoned Mr. Parkinson to follow. The trio were passing
through the wide hall of the main cabin when Captain O’Shea halted.
Swinging on his heel, he stood facing Charley Tong Sin, who started
slightly, for the visage of Captain O’Shea was stern and lowering.

What followed was instantaneous. The shipmaster’s fist shot out and
collided with the jaw of the comprador, who measured his length on the
floor and appeared to be wrapped in slumber. Only the toes of his neat
patent-leather shoes oscillated gently. The expression of his face was
singularly peaceful. The oblique eyelids were closed.

The aghast Mr. Parkinson sputtered in great dismay:

“My God, sir, what have you done? We’ll all go to jail for this. This
is Jordan, Margetson’s right-hand man.”

“I have given him a sleeping-powder,” said O’Shea. “Take him by the
heels while I carry the other end of him and we will lock him in a
spare state-room. Put a guard over him. If he squeals, hit him again
and keep him quiet.”

The mate was about to renew his protests, but his voice died in his
throat. Perceiving that he wavered miserably, Captain O’Shea spoke once
more, and his accents were hard:

“You can make your choice, Mr. Parkinson. Ye sail with me and you play
my game or you can go ashore to rot and starve on the beach, same as
when I picked ye out of the gutter. I have given this dirty young
Chinese blackguard a taste of what is coming to him. Will ye fall to or
shall I kick you out of the ship?”

“I--I will take your orders, sir,” stammered the other.

“Then help me get this steamer to sea. We will wait for no more Chinese
sailors. Muster all hands on the upper deck.”

They came piling up from the hold and the dining-room abaft the galley,
where most of them had been at breakfast. The inanimate comprador was
no longer visible.

“Will you sail with me at once or lose the chance of making the
voyage?” demanded O’Shea. “Some of you will have to shovel coal and
others wash dishes and do seamen’s duty on deck. But I will pay ye
extra for it, and we will take this old box of a steamer to where we
want to go.”

The response was hearty and unanimous. The adventurers could think of
no worse fate than to be once more stranded in Shanghai. They were well
fed, they had slept in clean beds again, and their employer was a man
who could be trusted to deal with them fairly. With a spirited cheer
they scattered to their various stations. The chief engineer spoke
briefly, his gray whiskers standing out in the morning breeze:

“Nobody but a wild Irishman would have the nerve to take this painted
coffin to sea with a gang of misbegotten greenhorns to man her. I have
steam enough to give her steerage-way whenever you’re ready to cast
off, Captain O’Shea.”

“Then let go, fore and aft,” roared the master. “Are ye pilot enough to
take her down the river, Mr. Parkinson?”

“I could do it with both eyes shut, but I’m not so familiar with the
coast to the north’ard.”

“I have a pilot for the part of the coast and the river we are bound
for,” grimly returned O’Shea. “He is locked in a spare state-room just
now. He will know that part of China very well, for ’tis me opinion
that he has been there before.”


V

Over a mournful, muddy expanse of the China Sea wallowed a top-heavy
river steamer whose engines raised protesting clamor like an assemblage
of threshing-machines. The gods of the air and water were in a kindly
mood or else she would have opened up and foundered ere now. In the
spray-swept wheel-house stood Captain Michael O’Shea, swaying easily
to the crazy roll and lurch of the _Whang Ho_ and scanning the low dim
coast with a pair of glasses. Clinging to the window ledge beside him
was a young man of a Chinese countenance whose raiment, the handiwork
of a fashionable British tailor, was sadly rumpled and soiled. The
whole aspect of the young man was rumpled, in fact, not to say
excessively forlorn, and now and then he pressed his hand against a
painful jaw. It was difficult to imagine that he had been an ornament
of clubs, a pattern for the gilded youth, and the smartest comprador
between Tientsin and Singapore.

The plight of Charley Tong Sin was made poignantly distressing by the
fact that in the process of acquiring the vices of the Occident he
had lost his grip on the essential virtues of the Orient. His native
stoicism had been sapped and the fatalistic attitude of mind which
meets death without so much as the flutter of an eyelid was eaten with
dry-rot. In other words, the comprador was willing to pay any price to
save his own skin, although his father before him would have suffered
himself to be sliced to death by inches sooner than “lose face” in the
presence of a foreigner.

Captain Michael O’Shea’s method of extracting information from this
kidnapped passenger had been brutally simple and direct. Charley Tong
Sin was informed that he could make a clean breast of it or be thrown
overboard. And the shipmaster, when he was thoroughly in earnest, had a
way of conveying the impression that he meant what he said. He believed
that he knew his man. The comprador was strongly reluctant to have his
head lopped off by the sword of a native executioner, which was very
likely to happen if this terrible O’Shea should turn him over to the
Chinese authorities. Given the promise of immunity in exchange for a
confession, he could flee to Japan or the Straits Settlements and
live handsomely in the society of other Chinese exiles with the funds
that he had piled up during his brief and brilliant business career.
Likewise there would be opportunities in shipping and commerce for a
comprador of his uncommon ability.

“I would honestly enjoy killing you, Charley,” said Captain O’Shea as
they stood together in the wheel-house of the _Whang Ho_. “You are a
smart lad, but ye got too gay with me, and you overplayed your game
when ye slipped under the counter of this steamer in a sampan in the
dark of the night and got busy with the red paint. That sort of silly
jugglery was the Chinese of it, I suppose. Now, I have tried to make it
plain that your life is not worth a pinch of snuff to any one of us.
There is not a man in the ship that wants to lay eyes on Shanghai ever
again. They will be only too glad to quit the country if they have the
price in their pockets, and I will give them the price. So ye must not
hold to the notion that we are afraid of getting in trouble on your
account.”

“I am worth more to you alive than if I am dead,” sullenly muttered
Charley Tong Sin. “Is it not so? You think I will be handy as a pilot,
as an interpreter? I have been doing a deuce of a lot of thinking. I am
no fool, Captain O’Shea. I know pretty well when I am licked. I made a
botch of it in Shanghai. You went blundering about like a buffalo, and
I thought it was a cinch to get you out of the way.”

“’Twas the luck of the Irish that pulled me through,” said O’Shea. “Now
we understand each other, Charley, me lad. I am staking all I have--me
life and me money--to get to the bottom of this infernal secret society
you have mixed yourself up with. ’Tis an instrument I am for the good
of humanity. And if ye turn state’s evidence to enable me to make a
clean, thorough job of it, I think I am justified in giving you a
chance to hot-foot it out of China.”

“Let us call it a bargain, Captain O’Shea. As we used to say in New
York, I am up against it good and plenty. To commit suicide, as many
Chinese would do in a fix like this, is all tommy-rot. Charley Tong Sin
could have no more gin cocktails--what?”

“You can begin the confession right away,” exclaimed the shipmaster.

“One thing at a time,” cheerfully replied the comprador. “I will
take you to the River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells and the village of
Wang-Li-Fu. Then you will find many very interesting things to ask me
to talk about.”

“And ye hope to give me the slip in the meantime,” and Captain O’Shea
showed no ill-will. “Very well, Charley. One thing at a time. Now take
these glasses and have a look at the coast. By my reckoning, we are far
enough to the north’ard to begin to haul inshore.”

The _Whang Ho_ was laboring abeam of a monotonous expanse of marshy
islands and ragged shoals made by the silt of river floods. The
shifting channels were poorly charted, for trade sought the inland
water-ways. The fact that the _Tai Yan_ steamer, with McDougal and Jim
Eldridge on board, had somehow found a passage leading from the sea
convinced Captain O’Shea that he could do likewise with a considerably
smaller vessel. Charley Tong Sin had admitted that he knew the way in,
and he was no more anxious to be drowned than the rest of the company.

“With good luck we can scrape over the sandbars on the afternoon tide,”
said the comprador, “and anchor in deep water for the night. I cannot
show you where to go in the dark. There are no lights.”

The _Whang Ho_ edged steadily nearer the coast. Her crew gazed ahead at
the frothing breakers that tumbled over the far-extended shoals, and
appeared unhappy. By a miracle their steamer was still under them after
struggling through rough winds and high seas, and now they were to be
wrecked, so all signs indicated, in a God-forsaken region of sand and
swamp and mud. However, there was no whimpering. Captain O’Shea, their
overlord, had a trick of knocking a man down and then listening to his
complaints. And he was as ready with a word of commendation as he was
with his disciplinary fists.

“Mr. Kittridge, if we hit bottom, put it to her and jam her over,”
he remarked to the chief engineer. “A chum of mine by the name of
Johnny Kent that sailed with me and held your berth used to clamp his
safety-valves when he had urgent need of steam. Did ye ever try it?”

“God forbid!” fervently ejaculated Mr. Kittridge; “but in this crazy
tub a man will do anything. If you find yourself flyin’ to glory with
a section of a boiler pokin’ in the small of your back, don’t lay it
against me, sir.”

“I like the way ye talk, Mr. Kittridge. Stand by your engines, if ye
please, for we will be in the white water before long.”

The _Whang Ho_ sheered to one side and shouldered past the outermost
shoals. O’Shea took the wheel, and Charley Tong Sin, cool and
quick-witted, told him how to follow the turbid, twisting channel that
wound its course between the sea and the wide mouth of the estuary.
More than once the steamer scraped the oozy bottom, hung and shivered
while the breakers pounded her, and then stubbornly forged ahead,
timbers groaning, boilers hissing, propeller kicking up clouds of mud
astern. It was evident that the channel had shoaled in places since any
other steamer had made the passage, and it was not at all certain that
the _Whang Ho_ could stand the strain of forcing her way to sea again.

“I have not been here since two years ago,” said the comprador. “It is
worse than I expected, you bet! Ai oh, a man that sails with you dies a
dozen deaths, Captain O’Shea.”

“I find it more comfortable than living in the best hotel in Shanghai,”
very pointedly returned the shipmaster as he climbed the spokes of the
big wooden wheel with hands and feet and wrenched the _Whang Ho_ clear
of a hungry sand-spit. By now she was fairly in the midst of the marshy
islands that extended from the watery main-land. The violence of the
surf was broken and the tide moved in broad, sluggish currents. Mr.
Parkinson, who was swinging the sounding lead, shouted that the channel
had deepened to five fathoms. The steamer had survived the passage.

Two miles farther inland she let go anchor in a wide lagoon. The
afternoon had waned. A cloudy twilight was closing down. On every hand
stretched a flat, unbroken region of swamp and creeks and rivers. No
villages were visible nor groves of trees against the sky-line to mark
the situation of a temple. A few small fishing-boats with ragged sails
fled at sight of the foreign steamer. The comprador waved his hand to
starboard and exclaimed:

“Yonder it is, the River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells, as you call it
in English. Wait till the tide goes down, and you will find out pretty
quick why the Chinese give it that funny name.”

“’Tis a filthy-looking country,” quoth Captain O’Shea. “It looks like
one great big sewer, with the yellow water and the sludge and the slime
on the banks.”

“It was all very well drained one time, long ago,” explained Charley
Tong Sin. “Then there were many people and towns. The Tai Pings
destroyed the canals and played the dickens with everything. And
nothing has been repaired, so the people don’t live here any more.”

“And where is this place called Wang-Li-Fu?” demanded O’Shea.

“Six miles up that stinking river. You think you will see the Painted
Joss to-morrow, Captain?”

“The Stinking River and the Painted Joss! You are loosening up,
Charley. I am near the end of me journey when you say things like that.
I have heard of them before.”

“Two other foreign men--only two--have seen the Painted Joss, and it
was unfortunate for them.” The comprador said this softly and with an
evil grin. He had overstepped the mark. Captain O’Shea gripped him by
the neck and shook him savagely as he thundered in his ear:

“Any more of that, and I will forget the bargain we made. One of those
men was a friend of mine, and by rights I ought to drill ye with a
bullet as a favor to him.”

Between chattering teeth Charley Tong Sin, suddenly abject, begged for
his life. Presently he moved restlessly from one deck to another, but
always a man followed and kept watch of him, as Captain O’Shea had
ordered. The ship’s company, most of them off duty and wearied with the
stress and hardships of the voyage, gathered under an awning stretched
between the deck-houses and talked in low tones. This melancholy, empty
landscape had a quality curiously depressing. With the falling tide the
swamps and the muddy banks were laid bare and the air became foul and
heavy with the smell of decayed vegetation, of ooze, of dead fish. The
ebb and flow of salt-water failed to cleanse and sweeten these sluggish
streams and stagnant lagoons and abandoned canals.

The men who had followed Captain O’Shea to this place were no longer
so many vagabonds and failures struggling for survival. They had been
welded together, in a way. They were an organization with something
like _esprit de corps_ and could be depended on to act as a unit.
Such a feeling as this brings to life dead self-respect and shattered
confidence. They knew not at all what the morrow might bring forth, but
every one of them was anxious to play the man, to stand the test, to
redeem himself in his own sight, to justify Captain O’Shea’s faith in
him.

It was not a night to invite sleep. The adventurers felt the immense
loneliness of this loathsome anchorage. It was unlike the populous
China which they had hitherto known. One might believe, with the
natives, that ghosts and demons had power to curse and blast a region
in which some violation of the _fung-shui_, or sacred rites of wind and
water, had angered the supernatural influences. The breeze died to a
dead calm. The lifeless air reeked with the stenches from the mouth of
the River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells.

It was drawing toward midnight when Mr. Kittridge came on deck and said
to Captain O’Shea, who was sitting with a group of his men:

“I shall have to start the pumps, sir. The vessel is leakin’ much worse
than when I first reported it.”

“Um-m, I was hoping we could lay her on a beach after we have finished
our business up the river and calk her plates,” replied the master of
the _Whang Ho_. “Is she making water faster than you can handle it,
Mr. Kittridge?”

“She acts to me as if a plate dropped clean out of her a few minutes
ago, sir. The pumps may help, but I have a notion that the whole
rotten, blankety river is runnin’ into her.”

Captain O’Shea jumped below and was promptly convinced that the gloomy
diagnosis of the chief engineer had a large basis of fact. The water
was fairly rushing into the holds and gurgling over the ballast. Likely
enough, the battering passage in from sea had sheared and wrenched away
enough rusty rivets to weaken the junction of two or more plates, and
they had been unable any longer to withstand the pressure. It really
made no difference whether or not this theory was the correct one. The
fact was that the venerable _Whang Ho_ had suddenly decided to lay
her bones in the mud with six fathoms of water above her keel. Mr.
Kittridge pensively caressed his gray whiskers and remarked with a sigh:

“I mentioned the pumps from force of habit. It’s really ridiculous to
stay below any longer, Captain. We gave the bloody old tub more than
she could stand, and she’s peacefully chucked it up. She’s sinkin’ very
quiet and decent, I’ll say that for her.”

“’Tis time we said good-by to her,” quoth O’Shea. “Draw your fires, if
you can, Mr. Kittridge, and I will get the boats ready.”

“I do seem to find trouble wherever I go,” sadly murmured the chief
engineer.

The men on deck took the news with no great show of excitement. This
was the kind of voyage which one could not reasonably expect to be
commonplace. To have to escape from a sinking steamer was an episode,
not a disaster. In few words, Captain O’Shea assured them that he had
no intention of letting this uncomfortable little happening interfere
with the business for which he had employed them. The insurance
underwriters would be out of pocket, but who cared a rap for them,
anyhow? Thereupon he issued orders, swiftly, intelligently, with
masterful vehemence. The two boats which appeared most serviceable
were swung outboard and held ready to launch. They would hold a dozen
men each without crowding. Water-kegs were filled, the galley and
store-room ransacked for tins of meat and biscuit, bags of potatoes
and rice. The fire-arms and cutlasses were served out and the cases
of ammunition divided between the two boats. Meanwhile the _Whang Ho_
continued to sink with a certain dignity and decorum. One could find
nothing dramatic in this shipwreck. Every one moved with haste, but
there was no outcry.

Only one mischance marred the exodus from the _Whang Ho_. All hands
were absorbed, and quite naturally, in delaying their departure as
little as possible. Delay meant something worse than wet feet. In fact,
the main deck was almost level with the water when the boats were ready
to shove clear. For once the _Whang Ho_ had moved rapidly, although
in a lamentable direction. With so much to do in so short a time, it
was not extraordinary that the vigilant espionage which surrounded
Charley Tong Sin should be relaxed, not to say forgotten, for a moment.
Even Captain O’Shea neglected to keep an eye on him, the business of
abandoning ship on a dark night at excessively short notice being
calculated to tax the resources of the most capable commander.

The comprador took advantage of these distractions to erase himself
from the scene. The boats were held against the side of the steamer,
while the captain took tally of the men in them, scrambling from one
boat to the other with a globe lantern swinging in his fist. Charley
Tong Sin was indubitably missing. O’Shea leaped on board the moribund
_Whang Ho_, which was now sobbing and gurgling tremendously, and made
a flying search of the cabins and state-rooms. It was obvious that
this elusive young Chinese had not vanished below decks, where by now
nothing but a fish could exist. And unless Captain Michael O’Shea
wished to join the fishes, it was time for him to go.

Chagrined and anxious, he returned to his boat, and the men frantically
plied oars. A moment or two later the _Whang Ho_ went under with very
little fuss, meeting her end with the calm of a Chinese philosopher.
The boats rocked in the waves that rolled away from the place where she
had been, and the rays of the lanterns revealed many large and greasy
bubbles.

Captain O’Shea wasted no time in sentimental regrets. The _Whang Ho_
was a dead issue. What vitally concerned him was the whereabouts of
that valuable passenger, Charley Tong Sin. It was absurd to suppose
that he had fallen overboard and given up the ghost. A rascal of his
kidney had as many lives as a cat. It was much more plausible to
surmise that he had unostentatiously laid hold of a life-belt, slipped
over the stern, and made for the nearest shore. The boats moved to
and fro, looking for him, but the darkness, misty and opaque, made it
hopeless to discover the head of a swimmer who by this time might have
left the water and concealed himself in the marsh.

“I misdoubt that me policy was sound,” said Captain O’Shea to Mr.
Kittridge. “Maybe I ought to have shot him, anyhow.”

“It would ha’ been a good job,” grunted the chief engineer. “And now
he’ll streak it for this village of Wang-Li-Fu and give an alarm.”

“Precisely that. But unless he can pick up a sampan or a fishing-boat
he will make slow headway flounderin’ through the swamps and swimming
the creeks. ’Tis up to us to beat him to it.”

Mr. Parkinson, who was in command of the other boat, was ordered to
steer alongside for consultation. It was promptly agreed that the party
should first find the mouth of the River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells
and then move up-stream without delay. It would be slow and blundering
navigation, but if three or four miles could be traversed before
daylight they might tie up to the bank and reconnoitre within striking
distance of their goal.

“I do not know what kind of a mess we will hop into,” O’Shea told them
before the boats separated. “We may have to fight our way, thanks
to that slippery divil of a comprador, and I am not asking ye to go
anywhere that I will not go meself. Some of you are not trained to use
weapons, but if ye will cut loose and blaze away and not think too much
about your own skins, we can make it uncomfortable for a slather of
Chinese. There is plenty of ammunition, so don’t scrimp yourselves.”

The boats slid slowly into the entrance of the wide, sluggish stream.
The lanterns were extinguished. The only sound was the cadenced
thump of the thole-pins. If any of the men felt the prickly chill of
cowardice, they kept it to themselves. Now and then the keels furrowed
the mud, and when the boats stranded hard and fast, the crews waded
overboard and shoved them ahead. Thus the little flotilla progressed
until dawn flushed the eastern sky and the vapors, streaming upward
from the marshes, curled and drifted like filmy clouds. Higher ground
and the green, checkered squares of tilled fields were discernible a
short distance beyond.

The boats turned into the mouth of a tiny creek where the tall rushes
curtained them from observation. This was a favorable halting place,
and a cold breakfast was hastily eaten. O’Shea had a poor opinion
of fighting on an empty stomach. He addressed himself with marked
deference to a very neatly dressed man with iron-gray hair who had said
little during the voyage. His face was haggard and his eyes were tired
with weariness of living.

“You have seen service, sir, and ye have led drilled men,” said O’Shea.
“The cards are dealt, but from now on you can play them better than I.
I will be obliged to ye for advice.”

The cashiered officer looked grateful. This kind of recognition had
power to move him. With a diffident manner, as if his professional
opinion had long since ceased to interest any one, he replied:

“Most Chinese villages are walled. There will be at least one gate
facing the river and two or three on the inland side. It is often
awkward to make a landing under fire from boats. I suggest we divide
our force. If you approve, Captain, I will take ten of the most active
men and disembark here. We can fetch a wide circuit of the town, and
it will not be difficult to make our way across the rice fields and
ditches. You can put the rest of them in one boat and row up in front
of the town, waiting in the stream until we are in a position to make a
rush. Then we will drive home a simultaneous attack in front and rear.”

“Napoleon could not beat it,” heartily exclaimed O’Shea. “And if ye
shoot fast enough and kick up a terrible racket, they will think ye are
an army. What will the signal be?”

“Three rifle shots.”

“Ay, ay, Mr. Bannister. ’Tis the sensible plan that ye take command of
the army while I hoist the rear-admiral’s pennant over the navy. We
have no reserves, but many a famous victory would have been missing
from history if the lads that won them had waited for the reserves to
come up.”

The chosen ten forsook the boats and tramped off behind their soldierly
leader. A few minutes later the expedition of Captain O’Shea got
under way, his boat hugging the muddy shore and dodging behind its
ragged indentations. It was not long before a wide curve of the river
disclosed to view the tiled roofs, the crumbling brick wall, and the
towered gate-ways of a village. In front of it were several rickety
wharfs, or stagings, built of bamboo poles lashed together. At the
outer end of one of these lay a two-masted junk, her hawse-holes
painted to resemble two huge eyes. The tide had begun to ebb, and the
junk was already heeled so that her deck sloped toward the river. This
craft appeared to be deserted. No pigtailed heads bobbed behind the
immensely heavy bulwarks. If the army officer had been a Napoleon,
Captain O’Shea showed himself a Nelson.

“Pull like blazes for the junk yonder,” he shouted to his men. “We will
pile aboard her and take cover.”

The junk was directly in front of the gate-way in the village wall,
and perhaps a hundred yards distant from it. The intervening space
was beach, a miry roadway, and a disorderly row of shanties made of
drift-wood, with a few boats hauled out for repairs. The heavy timbers
of the junk made her a nautical fortress, and the high sides would be
difficult of direct assault.

The men swung lustily at the oars, and the boat shot out into the open
river. O’Shea steered wide of the village until he could turn and make
directly for the junk. It was an admirable bit of strategy, but wholly
wasted on this sleepy, shabby Chinese village. There was never a sign
of a hostile demonstration. As an anticlimax the thing was absurd. A
crowd of men, women, and children streamed out through the gate in the
wall and stared with much excited chatter at the foreign invaders.
Apparently their behavior meant no more than a harmless curiosity.
Several garrulous old gentlemen squatted upon fragments of timber
and pulled at their bamboo pipes while they discussed the singular
visitation with the oracular demeanor of so many owls.

The bold O’Shea grinned sheepishly. His sensations were those of a man
who beheld a heroic enterprise suddenly turned into low comedy. He
glanced at the amused faces of his followers and said:

“’Tis not what ye might call a desperate resistance. Let us promenade
ashore and look the town over.”

They quitted their fortress and moved along the narrow, swaying staging
of bamboo, their rifles ready for use in the event of an ambuscade. The
Chinese crowd promptly retreated in noisy confusion. O’Shea ordered
a halt. After some delay, three signal shots came down the wind from
Major Bannister’s force. He was about to attack the village from the
landward side. Now the shopkeepers and coolies scuttled madly away
from O’Shea’s party to seek shelter within the walls and discover what
all this extraordinary excitement could mean.

Behind them tramped the naval brigade into streets from which the
inhabitants were vanishing as rapidly as possible. Somewhere near the
centre of the town O’Shea and Major Bannister joined forces. This pair
of valiant leaders eyed each other with mutually puzzled chagrin.

“We just walked in without the slightest trouble,” confessed the army
man. “What do you make of it?”

“I had the same experience,” observed O’Shea. “And I do not know what
to make of it at all. ’Twas me firm conviction that we were prancin’
into a hornet’s nest. The information all pointed that way. I would
call it a funny kind of a surprise party.”

“The villagers have no intention of making it unpleasant for us. They
have been giving my men eggs and melons and chickens, to keep us
good-natured, I presume.”

“Well, we will find quarters and fetch our grub from the junk, and I
will buy the drinks, if ye can locate them, for the joke seems to be on
me.”

They found the village tavern, consisting of several detached buildings
set in a large court-yard. The agitated landlord kow-towed himself
almost black in the face, and in trembling accents expressed his
desire to bestow all his goods upon the warlike foreigners if only
his miserable life might be spared. He summarily ejected a few native
guests of low degree, who fled without delaying to argue the matter.
The invaders set the tavern coolies to sweeping and scrubbing the
filthy buildings and took charge of the kitchen with its row of earthen
fire-pots. There was no lack of room for men to sleep three and four in
a row upon the _k’angs_, or brick platforms used for the purpose, and
the ragged quilts were hung outside to air. In short, the tavern was
transformed into a camp which had no serious discomforts.

Having taken care of his men, Captain O’Shea found leisure to ponder
over the situation, a process which left him with a headache. He
rambled unmolested from one end of the village to the other, searching
for clues that might link themselves with the Painted Joss and the
tragedy of Bill Maguire. There were two small, dilapidated temples, one
of them inhabited by a few Buddhist priests in yellow robes. O’Shea was
permitted to enter them and explore to his heart’s content. They were
nothing more than village shrines, however, in which the perfunctory
rites were held and offerings made--such places as might have been seen
in a thousand Chinese towns. Nor did the village itself, excepting for
an air of general decay, differ from the hamlets of a dozen provinces.

“I have a harrowing suspicion that Charley Tong Sin made a monkey of
me,” ruefully sighed O’Shea, “or maybe I have been all wrong from the
start. The Chinese proposition has too many twists in it for a white
man to fathom.”

As a person of considerable confidence in his ability to master
difficulties, his self-esteem had been dealt a hard blow. His
imagination had pictured a large, stirring climax of his pilgrimage,
and here he was all adrift in a wretched little village of no
consequence whatever, the last place in the world to find the
headquarters of a secret organization so mysteriously powerful as
to cast its sinister shadow throughout China, and even across the
seas. And yet the evidence had been by no means vague and misleading.
Beginning with the fragmentary revelations of the demented sailor,
coming next to the disclosures of poor McDougal’s diary, he had been
led straight to the town of Wang-Li-Fu, on the River of Ten Thousand
Evil Smells. He had felt that the hand of destiny was guiding him.

Returning to the tavern yard O’Shea found his men cheerfully making
friends of the villagers and accepting the situation with the ready
adaptability of true soldiers of fortune. They looked to the leader
for orders, but he had none to give them. He had been placed in the
ridiculous position of providing wages and rations for a perfectly
superfluous expeditionary force.

“Just what did you expect to turn up in this pigsty of a settlement?”
gloomily inquired Mr. Kittridge, who seemed disappointed that he had
not broken a few heads. “Whatever it was, it fell flat.”

“It did that,” frankly admitted O’Shea. “’Tis a painful subject, Mr.
Kittridge, and we will not discuss it now. But I am not done with the
riddle of Wang-Li-Fu.”

Three days passed, and singly and in squads the invaders ransacked the
village and its suburbs, poking into shops, alleys, dwellings, and
court-yards and taking stock of the inmates thereof. That the people
were very poor and very industrious was all that one could say of them.
And they were no more to be suspected of plotting deeds of violence
than so many rabbits. Doggedly persistent, unwilling to confess himself
beaten, O’Shea shifted his quest to the open country for miles outside
of Wang-Li-Fu. It was a region of green fields gridironed with ditches
and rutted paths, and dotted with toilers in blue cotton blouses and
straw hats, who tilled their crops from dawn to dark.

It was obviously useless to extend the investigation any considerable
distance away from this region. If the secret was not to be unearthed
in the vicinity of Wang-Li-Fu, then his conclusions had been all wrong.
The villagers assured him that this was, in truth, none other than
Wang-Li-Fu, and the baffled, perplexed O’Shea could not let go of the
opinion that the goal was somewhere near at hand. Otherwise, why all
the elaborate stratagems in Shanghai to thwart his voyage to the River
of Ten Thousand Evil Smells?

He had imagined himself attacking a stronghold of some sort, a
headquarters of desperate criminals who must be wiped out. But if that
slippery comprador Charley Tong Sin had carried a warning to the men of
the Painted Joss, he must have fled elsewhere than to this commonplace,
harmless village. At any rate, it seemed absurd to tarry much longer
in Wang-Li-Fu with a force of armed retainers.

At the end of a fortnight, O’Shea was of the opinion that his loyal
legion had better seek to mend its fortunes in some other quarter. He
was ashamed to look them in the face. The fiasco cut him to the quick.
He had been as mad as poor Bill Maguire. In future he would stick to
his trade as a shipmaster.

Meanwhile, the malarial poison of the marshes found its way into his
blood. He failed to realize that he was ill, and paid no attention to
the little flashes of fever that came by night and the creeping, chilly
feeling that troubled him in the morning.

There came a day when he was unable to rise from the brick
sleeping-platform. The fever increased, suddenly, violently. It caught
him unprepared. His plan of retreat had not been announced, and now he
was incapable of leadership. His mind alternated between delirium and
stupor. When he talked it was of many inconsequential things. One might
have said that the evil spirit of the Painted Joss had laid its spell
of misfortune upon him. In the court-yard of the tavern his lieutenants
held a conference.

“Can anybody make head or tail of this infernal situation?” gloomily
inquired Mr. Kittridge. “What in hades are we going to do about it?”

“Try to pull Captain O’Shea through this fever before we think of
anything else,” stoutly affirmed Mr. Parkinson. “We jammed into this
crazy voyage with our eyes shut. With all of us it was anything to get
clear of Shanghai. And it’s useless business to sit and growl about it
as hard luck. What do you say, Major Bannister?”

The army man smiled at sight of their discouraged countenances and
quietly answered:

“What else can we chaps expect but hard luck? Really, I should be
surprised to find anything else. I can tell you one thing, gentlemen. I
have campaigned in the tropics, and I know something about this swamp
fever. We had best get out of here and take Captain O’Shea with us. If
we don’t, he will die as sure as sunrise, and the rest of us will be
down with it before long. It caught him first because he was fagged
with worry.”

“We agree with you there,” said Mr. Parkinson. “But we seem to have
overlooked a line of retreat. That was the Irish of it, I suppose. If
we go down river in our two boats we’ll have to work ’em out to sea
over those nasty shoals and then run the chance of being picked up
adrift. We might get away with it, but it would kill a man as sick as
O’Shea.”

“Why not go up-river?” suggested Major Bannister. “By means of a few
words of Chinese and a great many gestures I have extracted from the
village head-men the information that there is a European mission
station about a hundred and fifty miles northwest of here. We can make
part of the journey by boat and then hike overland. With a litter and
coolies to carry it, we may be able to take Captain O’Shea through
alive. It’s better than letting him die in this pest-hole.”

“That’s the most sensible speech I’ve heard since we signed on,”
grunted Mr. Kittridge. “And you can pull out of this rotten Wang-Li-Fu
not a minute too soon to please me.”

The village head-men were summoned, and these venerable worthies
declared themselves anxious to aid the sick leader of the foreign
soldiers. He had played with their children, paid the shopkeepers their
prices without dispute, and sat with the old men in the tea-houses.
Nor had his armed force committed any abuses, although they held the
village at their mercy. It was wisdom to try to carry Captain O’Shea to
his own people. The village would gladly furnish a guide and plenty of
coolies, a covered litter, and a small house-boat in which the sick man
could be made comfortable.

The evacuation of Wang-Li-Fu was a dismal business. The adventurers
were oppressed by a sense of failure and discouragement. Their
enterprise had fizzled out like a dampened match. This final act was
inglorious. Their plight was worse than when they had been stranded as
beach-combers in Shanghai. They carried Captain O’Shea to a sampan,
or flat-bottomed boat, with a tiny cabin of bamboo and matting, which
could be towed against the sluggish current of the river. The men
disposed themselves in the two boats saved from the _Whang Ho_ steamer,
and a squad of half-naked coolies strung themselves along a towing-rope
to help track the sampan up-stream.

The sick man lay stretched upon his quilts and showed little interest
in the slow progress of the flotilla. Between spells of heavy
drowsiness he watched the slimy shore and fringing marsh slide past.
Through the first day the wind was cool and the air bright, and the
boats trailed up-river until after nightfall before they were pulled
into the bank to moor. As the part of caution, no fires were made and
conversation was hushed. The foreigners had an uncomfortable suspicion
that this might be hostile territory, although they had discovered
nothing to warrant the conjecture. But O’Shea had been babbling about
the Painted Joss while flighty with fever, and Charley Tong Sin was
still unaccounted for.

Between midnight and morning the sick man came out of his uneasy
dreams. As it seemed to him, he was clear-headed, his senses alert, his
judgment normal. Just why he should be cooped up in this native boat
was a bit difficult to comprehend, but why try to understand it? There
was only one problem of real importance. And now was the time to solve
it. O’Shea laughed to think what a stupid, blundering fool he had been
to recruit an armed expedition and come clattering into this corner of
China with so much fuss and noise.

If a man wanted to find the Painted Joss, all he had to do was listen
to the friendly, familiar voices that whispered in his ears. O’Shea
could hear them now. He accepted them as a matter of course. His eyes
were very bright as he pulled on his shoes and fumbled for the revolver
in its holster under the pillow. Curiously enough, he was no longer
conscious of great physical weakness. It was tremendously urgent that
he should go to find the Painted Joss without a moment’s delay. His men
would not understand if he should tell them about the friendly voices
that were offering to show him the way. They might try to restrain him.
He must leave the boat quietly, unobserved.

Crawling from beneath the matting curtain, he gained the river bank.
His knees were exceedingly shaky and his hands trembled uncertainly,
but he was confident that he had found the trail of the Painted Joss
and that his vigor would soon return. Charley Tong Sin outwit him?
Nonsense! O’Shea would have been startled beyond measure to know that
he was wandering off in delirium. He would have taken a shot at any one
rash enough to tell him so.

Undetected he moved along the shore, silent as a red Indian, and was
presently lost in the darkness. It was muddy walking, and he turned
into the tall marsh grass, where a carpet of dead vegetation made
firmer footing. Frequently he was compelled to halt and regain his
labored breath, but his purpose was unwavering. The voices drove him
on. He had no sense of fear. After some time his erratic progress led
him back to the river. There he stumbled over a log and sat down to
wait for daybreak, which had begun to flush the sky.

His head throbbed as though hammers were pounding it and waves of
blurring dizziness troubled him. What was more disquieting, the guiding
voices had ceased to talk to him. He felt crushing disappointment and
sadness. His eyes filled with tears.

Dawn found him seated dejectedly with his back propped against the
log, his head drooping, while he stared at the muddy river. Here he
would wait on the chance that his friends might find him. As the day
brightened, his aimless vision was caught by something which powerfully
awakened his weary, befogged perceptions. It acted as a stimulant of
tremendous force. Sitting bolt upright he gazed at a footprint, cleanly
outlined, which had become sun-dried and hardened in a stratum of clay.

It had been made by a leather sole and heel. The outline was pointed
and narrow. Into O’Shea’s quickened memory there flashed the picture
of Charley Tong Sin stretched upon the cabin floor of the _Whang Ho_
steamer, his patent-leather shoes waving gently as he went to sleep
under the soporific influence of a knock-out blow. He felt absolutely
certain that this particular print had been left by the fashionable
footgear of the vanished comprador. The voices had guided him aright.
It was here that Charley Tong Sin had come ashore after making his way
up the River of Ten Thousand Evil Smells in some kind of a native boat.

There was one chance in a million that O’Shea should have halted to
wait in this precise spot where his eyes might see the thing. He
dragged himself to his feet and scanned the melancholy landscape.
There were no villages in sight; only the marsh and fields and a vast
mound of débris to mark the place where once had stood a city. Even
the walls surrounding it had been levelled. It was scarcely more than
a wide-spread excrescence of broken brick and tiling partly overgrown
with vegetation. The landscape could have held no more desolate
reminder of the wreckage left in the wake of the Tai Ping rebels.

It was plausible to surmise that this was the real Wang-Li-Fu, the city
which O’Shea had set out to find. The squalid village much lower down
the river might have been founded by refugees who gave the same name to
their new abode. And the villagers had been too ignorant to explain the
blunder. To them there was only one Wang-Li-Fu. How Charley Tong Sin
must have laughed at leaving O’Shea and his men to waste themselves in
a chase that led nowhere.

It was a pallid, unshaven, tottering ghost of Captain Michael O’Shea
that mustered strength to walk very slowly in the direction of the
ruined city. Once he paused and became irresolute, but a little way
beyond he found the imprint of a narrow shoe of European workmanship
on the soft bank of a ditch. His stumbling steps led him, as by an
unerring divination, toward the highest part of the great mound of
débris where tall trees grew from the crumbling masonry. His painful
advance became less difficult when he found a path from which the
obstructions had been removed.

Presently he stood looking across a cleared space in the midst of
the ruins, invisible from river or highway. In it were several small
buildings and one much larger. The timbers set into its walls were
carved and gilded, the curving roof of dull red tile. There was no
living thing in sight. This isolated community was so situated that it
was wholly concealed from strangers, and the natives of the region were
apt to shun the blasted city as haunted by demons. No watchers were
posted to guard against intrusion.

O’Shea crossed the open space and made for the large building,
which had the aspect of a temple. Unhesitatingly he approached the
massive wooden doors and found them ajar. He walked like a man in a
trance, muttering to himself. Passing within, he entered a sort of
anteroom partitioned by means of screens wonderfully embroidered.
The stone pavement rang to the tread of his heels. The place echoed
with emptiness. He pressed on and came into a room of greater extent.
Its corners were lost in shadow. Rows of pillars supported the dusky
rafters upon which gilded dragons seemed to writhe. The windows were
small and set close to the roof and the light of early morning had not
dispelled the gloom.

In the centre of the floor was an altar. Behind it towered an image of
Buddha, and yet it was unlike the images of the bland and contemplative
Buddha commonly to be found in the temples of the East. It was a
monstrous thing. Only an artist with an inspiration from the devil
could have so handled tools as to make those wooden features seem to
lust after all abominable wickedness. The color of this seated statue
was crimson. Amid the shadows it glowed like fire or blood. On the
breast, above the folded arms, stood out in broad, black strokes a
Chinese symbol or character which O’Shea recognized with a sensation of
creeping repugnance.

“The Painted Joss!” he gasped.

His attention was so strongly caught and held by this malevolent image
that for the moment he had eyes for nothing else. Presently, however,
he became aware that another figure confronted him, a living presence.
It was a man sitting in a massive chair of teak-wood, by the side of
the Buddha. The bulk of him was enormous. He was both fat and mighty
of frame, and not even the towering amplitude of the image could dwarf
his proportions and belittle the impression he conveyed. His face
was broad and heavy-jowled, the mouth sensual and cruel. With folded
arms he sat and gazed at the foreign intruder. This unflinching,
scornful immobility had a certain distinction. He believed that he must
instantly die at the hands of this European with the white, savage face
and the blazing eyes who covered him with a revolver. It was futile to
cry out and summon help. As is customary with Chinese in positions of
authority, this high-priest of iniquity had gone to the temple to have
audience with his servitors very early in the morning. They had not yet
joined him and O’Shea was quick to read his own advantage.

It was right and just that he should slay this huge man in the
crimson robe who ruled the temple of the Painted Joss. He had come
ten thousand miles to be judge and executioner. He was ready to kill
and be killed in his turn. But the revolver was strangely heavy and
it wavered so that he was unable to hold it at arm’s length. A haze
bothered his vision and he could not brush it from his eyes. Something
was the matter with his knees. They were giving way. With an incoherent
exclamation, O’Shea fell unconscious upon the stone flagging and
the revolver clattered from his limp hand. He had paid the price of
exertion beyond his strength.

When his senses returned there was in his mind only the dimmest
recollection of how he came to be in this dreadful place. The vagaries
of fever no longer possessed him. Clear-headed but wretchedly weak and
nerveless, he gazed about him and discovered that he was alone in the
unholy temple. The shadows were not so heavy on the pillars, the gilded
rafters, and the marble altar. The crimson image of the seated Buddha
loomed flamboyant and portentous and the Chinese symbol painted on its
breast was boldly outlined.

There was no way of escape. The building was a most effectual prison.
His revolver had been taken from him. He could not even fight and die
like a man. The fact was that this desperate extremity lacked the
proper sense of reality. It was so contrary to reason and he had such
shadowy, confused ideas of what had preceded, that this was more like
nightmare or delirium. And it seemed impossible that he should not
presently find himself awake.

What most tenaciously persisted in his memory was the image of the huge
man in the teak-wood chair. He was a vision which could not be denied.
Such a one as he had power to sway the wills of others to his desires,
to create and direct great enterprises and send his influence afar, but
never for good. If he ordered murder done in distant places his secret
edicts would be obeyed, nor would his agent dare to thwart him. If
there was such an organization as O’Shea had assumed, then he had stood
face to face with the dominant personality, the compelling force from
which radiated infernal activities.

“I saw him, whether I am meself or somebody else,” the prisoner
muttered with a groan. “And he will come back and the brand will be
chopped into me, same as was done to poor Bill Maguire. ’Tis a tough
finish, if all this is really true. My God, I wish I knew what had
happened to me. Yesterday I was going up-river with me men, and now----”

He struggled to his feet. A supreme effort of will conquered physical
weakness. A man condemned to die is capable of forgetting bodily ills.
Just then a young man appeared from the direction of the door-way. He
wore native garments, but O’Shea recognized him. It was Charley Tong
Sin, whose smile was unpleasant. In his hand was O’Shea’s revolver,
which he was careful to hold ready for use. The jaunty, affable manner
of the comprador had returned. He appeared very well satisfied with
himself as he exclaimed, by way of greeting.

“It is an unexpected pleasure, you bet, Captain O’Shea. I have waited
till you were gone from Wang-Li-Fu. It was reported that you were very
sick and went up the river yesterday with your men. You decided to come
and see us, to visit the Painted Joss? You wished to make some trouble?”

“’Tis the last day I will make trouble for any one, by the looks of
things,” replied O’Shea. “You win, Charley.”

“You are a smart man,” grinned the other. “But you had too much
curiosity. I am a good fellow. I will tell you what you want to know.
You will not give it away. They are getting ready to cut your visit
pretty short.”

There was the chatter of voices somewhere outside and the brazen mutter
of a gong. O’Shea kept silence. He was not as resigned to his fate as
Charley Tong Sin inferred. He was watching every motion of the gloating
young man and his eyes measured the distance between them.

“You will feel better if you know,” tauntingly cried the Chinese. “You
have seen the Painted Joss. You have seen a man sitting beside it, the
great and terrible Chung himself, the ruler of the Pih-lien-Kiao, the
_Sect of the Fatal Obligation_.”

“Much obliged, Charley,” grimly interrupted O’Shea. “Tell me some more.
I am sorry I could not have words with the terrible Chung. And the
brand that ye chop into people, your trademark?”

“It is the mark that means _The Dreadful Messenger of Chung_. It is
a favor to tell you, Captain O’Shea. No other foreigner, no Chinese
except the servants of Chung, have heard it spoken. But you will not
speak it anywhere.”

“There’s more that I want to know,” said O’Shea, “though precious
little good the information will do me.”

“Ha! Why did you not have so much sense before and mind your own
business?”

It was absurd to carry on such a dialogue as this, as O’Shea perceived,
but Charley Tong Sin was enjoying this session with the rash shipmaster
who had formerly held the upper hand. Before the victim could be
subjected to further taunts he heard the massive doors opened and
other sounds to indicate that bars were sliding into place to fasten
them on the inside. The huge man in the crimson robe, the great and
terrible Chung, lumbered into view and seated himself in the chair of
teak-wood. Charley Tong Sin humbly bowed several times. The personage
beckoned the twain nearer and spoke briefly. He desired to conduct a
cross-examination of his own with the comprador as interpreter.

“He wishes to know why you have come to this place?” was the first
question addressed to O’Shea.

“Because ye butchered a friend of mine, a red-headed sailor by the name
of Jim Eldridge,” was the unflinching reply. “He told me about your
dirty devilment as well as he could, and I saw what ye did to him.”

The huge man showed signs of consternation when this was conveyed to
him. He uttered a bellowing interrogation.

“He is not alive? You have talked with his ghost?” shrilly demanded
Charley Tong Sin.

“’Twas him that sent me here,” declared O’Shea. “Ye can impart it to
the big ugly mug yonder that I have had visits from the ghost of the
red-headed sailor that he killed and branded.”

With an excited, heedless gesture, Charley Tong Sin raised the
revolver. He had been long accustomed to wearing European clothes, and
the flowing sleeves of his Chinese outer garment impeded his motions. A
fold of the silk fabric fell over the butt of the weapon, and he tried
to brush it aside with his left hand. This other sleeve was caught and
held for a moment by the sharp firing-pin of the cocked hammer.

This trifling mishap, gave O’Shea a desperate opportunity. With a flash
of his normal agility he leaped across the intervening space. The
comprador strove frantically to free the weapon, but only entangled it
the more. The episode was closed before the crimson-robed personage
could play a part. O’Shea’s shoulder rammed Charley Tong Sin and sent
him sprawling, and the revolver was instantly wrested from his grasp.

“The doors are locked,” panted O’Shea, “and before your men break in, I
will send the both of ye to hell. Sit where you are, ye terrible Chung.
You overplayed your game, Charley.”

The comprador seemed to shrink within his clothes. His mouth hung open
and his face was ashen. He was eager to clutch at any straw which might
give him the chance of life. Shrinking from the scowling presence in
the chair, he began to talk a sing-song babble of words that tumbled
over each other.

“I will help you get away alive if you do not kill me. Captain O’Shea,
I will explain about Jim Eldridge; I will not lie to you. All the
secrets I will tell you. There was a steamer, the _Tai Yan_, and she
came over the bar from the sea in a big storm, at the time of a flood.
It was do this or go to the bottom because the engines had broke.
A boat with sailors rowed up the river. They were foolish men who
believed the stories that gold and silver treasure was hidden in the
ruins of this old Wang-Li-Fu. And they found this temple, and they knew
too much.

“All but two of the men were able to run quick to the river, but
Eldridge and one named McDougal ran into this place, trying to hide.
They ran into the temple before they were captured. There was a
little building, but now it is ashes and much sticks of burnt wood.
In that building those two men were locked to be killed next day. The
red-headed man was a demon, I tell you. Walls could not hold him. In
the night he set fire to the building, and it was a great blaze. But he
was caught and punished.”

“Ye left him for dead, and he came to,” growled O’Shea. “And so
McDougal got away!”

“I can tell you more secrets,” wailed Charley Tong Sin, but his
services as an informer were suddenly cut short. The huge man in
the chair had raised his voice in a tremendous call for help to his
followers without. Otherwise he had sat composed, glaring at O’Shea.
It was his hand that slew Charley Tong Sin as a traitor. He was on his
feet, the heavy chair raised aloft. He swung it with amazing ease. It
was no longer a massive article of furniture, but a missile in the
hands of a man of gigantic strength. His movements were not clumsy.

The chair flew through the air. O’Shea dodged, but Charley Tong Sin
flung up his arms, taken unawares. The impact would have brained an ox.
The whirling mass of teak smote the terrified comprador on the head
and chest and he crumpled to the pavement. He was as dead as though he
had been caught beneath the hammer of a pile-driver. The tableau was
an extraordinary one. O’Shea stood staring at the broken body of the
young Chinese. The man in the crimson robe stirred not from his tracks.
Implacable, unafraid, he had executed the last sentence of _The Sect of
the Fatal Obligation_.

The people outside were clamoring at the doors, and O’Shea heard the
thud and crash of some kind of an improvised battering-ram. He sighed
and found the thought of death at their hands very bitter. But he would
not go alone. He faced the great and terrible Chung and slowly raised
the revolver.

The arch-assassin bade him wait with a gesture so imperious, so
mandatory, that O’Shea hesitated. The bearing of the man held some
large significance. His dark, evil countenance expressed rather sadness
than wrath. He slid a hand into the folds of his robe and raised the
hand to his mouth. Whatever it was that he swallowed wrought its work
with swift and deadly virulence. Swaying like a tree about to fall, he
strode to the marble altar and fell across it with his head buried in
his arms. In this posture he died, in front of the image of the glowing
Buddha, whose graven lineaments seemed to express the unholy ambitions
and emotions of his own soul.

O’Shea managed to walk to a corner of the temple and slumped down upon
a marble bench where the Painted Joss cast its deepest shadow. His
strength had ebbed again. Listlessly, almost inattentive, he heard the
assault upon the doors renewed and the splintering of plank. When the
Chinese mob came tumbling in he could try to shoot straight and hit a
few of them, and then they would close in on him. It was the end of the
game.

A few minutes and the servitors of Chung came jostling and shouting
through the anteroom. Then they halted abruptly. Their noise was
hushed. The light that fell from the windows near the roof showed them
the lifeless figure in the crimson robe, doubled across the marble
altar. In the foreground lay the battered body of Charley Tong Sin, but
they had eyes only for the tragedy of the altar. They stood dumfounded,
like men in the presence of something incredible.

At length the boldest shuffled forward. The others followed timidly.
They appeared terrified in the extreme. It was as though they had
believed their master to be invulnerable. And he was dead. Possibly
they conjectured that he had been slain by an agency more than mortal.
The group of Chinese clustered about the altar, whispering, regarding
the body of Chung. Apparently they had not bethought themselves of the
foreigner who was held a prisoner in the temple.

O’Shea rose in his shadowy corner and moved wearily past the Painted
Joss. It was better to have the thing finished. He came upon the
Chinese like an apparition. Their wits were so fuddled that the sight
of him had the effect of another shock. If he had been powerful enough
to slay the mighty Chung, then the demons were his allies. Perceiving
their dazed condition, he forebore to shoot, and advanced abreast of
the altar. The path to the door-way was clear, but he had not the
strength to make a run for it. The hope of life, miraculously restored
to him, was in the possibility that they might stand and gaze at him a
little longer.

He had walked a half-dozen steps farther when one of the crowd yelled.
The spell was broken. They raced after him like wolves. He turned and
steadied himself and pulled trigger until the revolver was empty.
The onset was checked and thrown into bloody confusion. O’Shea had
summarily convinced them that whether or not the demons were in league
with him, the devil was in this ready weapon of his.

They were no longer massed between him and the exit, and for the moment
the advantage undeniably belonged to this mysterious, devastating
foreigner.

He stumbled over the broken timbers of the doors and was in the blessed
daylight, the temple behind him. He would be overtaken ere he could
flee the ruined city, but he reloaded the revolver as he followed the
path at a staggering trot. The mob poured out of the temple, yelping
in high-keyed chorus. As a foot-racer the hapless Captain Michael
O’Shea was in excessively poor condition. In fact, it promised to be
the easiest kind of a matter to overtake him and leisurely pelt him to
death with bricks as soon as he should have expended his ammunition.

He swerved from the rough path and crawled to the top of a low ridge
of débris. Standing erect for a moment, he pitched forward and fell
against a bit of wall. His figure had been outlined against the sky,
and it was discerned in a fleeting glimpse by a scattered band of men
in khaki and linen clothes who were tramping the marsh. They raised a
shout and rushed toward the ruined city, converging until the force was
mobilized within a short distance of the prostrate O’Shea.

The Chinese mob, pursuing full-tilt, found itself confronting a score
and more of rifles which enthusiastically opened fire until the air
hummed with bullets. There was a hasty, unanimous retreat of the
followers of Chung to the temple and the adjacent buildings. Major
Bannister halted to bend over O’Shea and say:

“We thought you were drowned or bogged in the marsh. What sort of a
rumpus is this?”

“The Painted Joss,” murmured O’Shea. “I found it. Don’t bother with me.
Go to it and clean out the place.”

The adventurers, at last earning their wages, proceeded to make
things most unpleasant for the household of Chung. The resistance was
brief, and those who were not penned within the temple fled in panic
and sought cover in the marsh. They were taken by surprise, for the
community had found the visit of Captain O’Shea sufficient to engage
its attention. To him returned Major Bannister, hot and dusty, his
cheek bleeding from the cut of a Chinese sword, and smilingly announced:

“Bully good fun while it lasted. What shall I do with the devils we
cornered? Take them out and shoot them?”

“No. The boss of the works is dead. And I have a notion that _The Sect
of the Fatal Obligation_ died with him. Lug me to the temple, if ye
please. I’m all in, but ’tis my wish to see the whole wicked business
go up in smoke.”

Before the torch was applied, that experienced man of war, Major
Bannister, suggested that he had never seen a more promising place in
which to poke about for loot. The search amounted to nothing until it
occurred to the major to pull the Painted Joss from off its pedestal.
After much heaving and prying the great image fell crashing to the
pavement of the temple. Investigation revealed that underneath it were
several compartments accessible by means of cunningly fitted panels.
Many papers or documents were found, wrapped in silk, and it was
assumed that these were the records of the black deeds of Chung and his
organized murderers. They were thrown aside, to be bundled together and
taken to the boats.

It was the astute Major Bannister who smashed the bottom of one of
these compartments with a rifle-butt and rammed his hand through the
splintered hole. His groping fingers came in contact with closely
packed rows of metal bars. In this manner was discovered the wealth of
the temple, the blood-money stored and treasured by the infamous Chung,
the price of many assassinations.

The gold was in stamped ingots, the silver in the lumps or “shoes”
of the clumsy Chinese currency, and there were baskets of English
sovereigns, Mexican dollars, and a variety of the coinages which pass
over the counters of the money-changers of the Orient. Murder as a
business had paid well. _The Sect of the Fatal Obligation_ was a
flourishing concern. The loot belonged to those who found it. They were
troubled by no scruples respecting the heirs of the departed Chung, nor
did they consider it their duty to surrender the spoils to the Chinese
government.

That night a conflagration reddened the ruins of the dead city of
Wang-Li-Fu. It was the pyre of the Painted Joss. And when the little
flotilla again moved up-river early next morning, a cloud of smoke rose
lazily in the still air. Captain Michael O’Shea was still alive, which
was rather surprising, for he had passed through experiences extremely
disturbing to a sick man. There was tonic, however, in the fact that he
had redeemed his failure, the expedition was no longer a sorry jest,
and the account of Bill Maguire had been squared.

He slept with tremendous earnestness through a night and a day, and
when he awoke it was to roar for food and to display the peevish temper
of a genuine convalescent. When off duty his comrades became absorbed
in the odd occupation of arranging piles of gold bars, silver “shoes,”
and minted coins on the deck of the little house-boat, like children
playing with blocks. They smiled a great deal and talked to themselves.
Captain O’Shea looked on with an air of fatherly interest. After all,
this happy family of his had made a prosperous voyage of it. Dreams
of rehabilitation cheered these broken wanderers. They would go home.
No more for them the misery, the heartache, the humiliation of the
tropical tramp. Their riches might slip through their fingers, but they
would make the most of golden opportunity. Like poor McDougal, they had
thrown all regrets away.

“’Tis share and share alike,” said O’Shea, “but there is a red-headed
sailor-man at anchor on a farm in Maine and I think he has a wife
somewheres. With your permission we will deal him a share of the
plunder. ’Twas poor Bill Maguire that gave us the tip.”

Unmindful of labor and hardship, this contented company slowly
journeyed to the head of navigation on the River of Ten Thousand Evil
Smells and then trudged overland while O’Shea rode in a covered chair
and sang old sea-chanties in a mellow voice. When, at length, the
English mission station was reached it was stretching the truth to call
him an invalid. The senior missionary, a gentle, very wise old man who
had lived for thirty years in the back country, heard the tale told
by these tanned, ragged travellers and was horrified that such things
should have existed. But he had news for them, and it was thus that he
supplied a missing fragment of the puzzle of Bill Maguire:

“The man came here and we took care of him. But there was no finding
out how he had been so frightfully hurt. He was dumb and stupid.
Later I met a native boatman who had found him on the river-bank near
Wang-Li-Fu. Evidently he had been thrown into the water as an easy way
to get rid of the body. Reviving a little, he splashed his way ashore
or the tide left him there. He stayed with us until he was fairly
strong and one morning he was gone.”

“And did he set the house afire?” inquired O’Shea.

“Why, there were two accidental fires in the compound at that time,
but we laid it to the carelessness of the kitchen coolies,” was the
innocent reply.

“It was Bill Maguire, all right,” declared O’Shea. “Now, will ye be
good enough to look over the Chinese documents we found hid away under
the Painted Joss?”

The missionary pored over the papers for several hours. And his
painstaking translation revealed all that O’Shea cared to know
concerning the operations of _The Sect of the Fatal Obligation_. It had
worked in secret to remove enemies for a price. If a merchant wished
a business rival obliterated, if an official found others in his way,
if it was advantageous to create a vacancy in some other quarter, the
murder guild directed by the departed Chung would transact the affair,
smoothly, without bungling. And those who knew and would have disclosed
the secret were frightened into silence by the sight of the brand that
was called _The Dreadful Messenger of Chung_.

“It will interest you to learn, as an American, Captain O’Shea,” said
the missionary, “that among these documents is a list of persons
proscribed or sentenced to be slain. The most conspicuous name I
find to be that of the Chinese ambassador to the United States, His
Excellency Hao Su Ting. It is probable that this terrible fate would
have awaited him upon his return to his own country.”

“They potted his brother,” exclaimed O’Shea. “And he was sick with fear
of the thing, for I talked it over with him meself. Well, he can thank
Bill Maguire for letting him die in his bed when his proper time comes.”

Three weeks later Captain O’Shea sat at his ease upon the piazza of the
Grand Hotel, that overlooks Yokohama Bay. He was thinner than when he
had put to sea in the _Whang Ho_ steamer, but he appeared to find the
game of life quite worth while. It was his pleasure to enjoy the tame
diversions of a tourist before boarding a mail-boat for the long run
home to San Francisco. He smiled as he reread a letter written in the
crabbed fist of that zealous agriculturist, Johnny Kent, who had this
to say:

    DEAR CAPTAIN MIKE:

    The Lord only knows what trouble you’ll be in when this gets to
    China. My advice is to quit it and come home. I’m worried about
    you. Bill Maguire has rounded to, understand? His busted main hatch
    sort of mended itself by degrees. He had symptoms before you left,
    and you ought to have waited, but I suppose you can’t help being
    young and Irish.

    He was terrible melancholy at first, and he ain’t real spry yet. I
    found his wife and little girl for him in Baltimore, and made them
    come on here. You guessed right about the wax doll. I bought the
    darndest, biggest one I could find. Bill feels that the family is
    living on my charity, and being morbid and down-hearted, he frets a
    whole lot about being broke and stranded. He’ll be no good to go to
    sea again. It gives him the shivers to talk about it. I don’t need
    him as a farm-hand in the winter, and as for having his wife as a
    steady house-keeper, I’m fussy and set in my ways.

    Bill got up against an awful bad combination in China. I won’t tell
    you where it was, for I don’t want you to find it. Maybe you’ll run
    across a man named McDougal out there. He was with Bill when they
    got in trouble. Bill saw a chance to get away in the night, but he
    stood the crowd off somehow to give McDougal leeway to join him.
    And this McDougal lit out with never a thought for Bill. There was
    something wrong with McDougal, as I figure it out. Maybe he was a
    good man, but here was one time when he fell down on his job. None
    of us say much about it, Captain Mike, but we all pray we won’t get
    caught that way. You know what I mean. We’re afraid there may be a
    weak spot in us that we don’t know is there until we have to face
    the music. Anyhow, as I gather from Bill, McDougal was a quitter.
    If I know anything about men, he has wished a hundred times since
    that he had stayed to take his medicine with Bill. We would a heap
    sight rather see you come home alive than to go monkeying with
    the Painted Joss. Nothing much has happened except a dry spell in
    August and corn and potatoes set back. Hens are laying well.

                                                  Your friend,
                                                            J. KENT.

Captain O’Shea chuckled and then became thoughtful. Paddy Blake and
McDougal. Charley Tong Sin and the wreck of the _Whang Ho_. Wang-Li-Fu
and the terrible Chung. Much can happen within the space of a few weeks
to a man that will seek the long trail. Presently he took from his
leather bill-book several slips of paper which he had received from the
Yokohama Specie Bank in exchange for his gold bars and silver “shoes.”
After making sundry calculations with a pencil, he said to himself:

“The share of Jim Eldridge, alias Bill Maguire, is nine thousand
eight hundred and sixty-two dollars and eleven cents, and ’tis here
all ship-shape in two drafts on New York. My piece of the loot is the
same. But the red-headed sailorman will never be the lad he was, and he
should not be worried by the lack of money to live on. And could any
money pay for what he went through? ’Tis easy to know what I should do.
I will not take a cent of the plunder. My share I will give to Bill,
and with his bit of it he will be comfortably fixed.”

An expression of boyish satisfaction brightened his resolute features
as he added:

“A man would be ashamed to take money for such a pleasant vacation as
this one has been. Now, I will send a cable message to Bill Maguire and
it will cheer him a lot. His account is squared. And I think I have put
a crimp in _The Sect of the Fatal Obligation_.”

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
