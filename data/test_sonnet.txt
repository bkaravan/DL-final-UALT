 when in the chronicl of wast time , 
 i see descript of the fairest wight , 
 and beauti make beauti old rhyme , 
 in prais of ladi dead , and love knight , 
 then in the blazon of sweet beauti 's best , 
 of hand , of foot , of lip , of eye , of brow , 
 i see their antiqu pen would have express , 
 even such a beauti as you master now . 
 so all their prais are but propheci 
 of thi our time , all you prefigur , 
 and for they look but with divin eye , 
 they had not skill enough your worth to sing : 
 for we which now behold these present day , 
 have eye to wonder , but lack tongu to prais . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 not mine own fear , nor the prophet soul , 
 of the wide world , dream on thing to come , 
 can yet the leas of my true love control , 
 suppos as forfeit to a confin doom . 
 the mortal moon hath her eclips endur , 
 and the sad augur mock their own presag , 
 incertainti now crown themselv assur , 
 and peac proclaim oliv of endless age . 
 now with the drop of thi most balmi time , 
 my love look fresh , and death to me subscrib , 
 sinc spite of him i 'll live in thi poor rhyme , 
 while he insult o'er dull and speechless tribe . 
 and thou in thi shalt find thi monument , 
 when tyrant ' crest and tomb of brass are spent .

 what 's in the brain that ink may charact , 
 which hath not figur to thee my true spirit , 
 what 's new to speak , what now to regist , 
 that may express my love , or thi dear merit ? 
 noth sweet boy , but yet like prayer divin , 
 i must each day say o'er the veri same , 
 count no old thing old , thou mine , i thine , 
 even as when first i hallow thi fair name . 
 so that etern love in love 's fresh case , 
 weigh not the dust and injuri of age , 
 nor give to necessari wrinkl place , 
 but make antiqu for aye hi page , 
 find the first conceit of love there bred , 
 where time and outward form would show it dead . 
 <VER>

 o never say that i wa fals of heart , 
 though absenc seem my flame to qualifi ,

 like him that travel i return again , 
 just to the time , not with the time exchang , 
 so that my self bring water for my stain , 
 never believ though in my natur reign , 
 all frailti that besieg all kind of blood , 
 that it could so preposter be stain , 
 to leav for noth all thi sum of good : 
 for noth thi wide univers i call , 
 save thou my rose , in it thou art my all .

 ala whi fear of time 's tyranni ,

 love is a babe , then might i not say so

 my love is as a fever long still , 
 for that which longer nurseth the diseas , 
 feed on that which doth preserv the ill , 
 th ' uncertain sickli appetit to pleas : 
 my reason the physician to my love , 
 angri that hi prescript are not kept 
 hath left me , and i desper now approv , 
 desir is death , which physic did except . 
 past cure i am , now reason is past care , 
 and frantic-mad with evermor unrest , 
 my thought and my discours as mad men 's are , 
 at random from the truth vainli express . 
 for i have sworn thee fair , and thought thee bright , 
 who art as black as hell , as dark as night . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 o me ! what eye hath love put in my head , 
 which have no correspond with true sight , 
 or if they have , where is my judgment fled , 
 that censur fals what they see aright ? 
 if that be fair whereon my fals eye dote , 
 what mean the world to say it is not so ? 
 if it be not , then love doth well denot , 
 love 's eye is not so true as all men 's : no , 
 how can it ? o how can love 's eye be true , 
 that is so vex with watch and with tear ? 
 no marvel then though i mistak my view , 
 the sun it self see not , till heaven clear . 
 o cun love , with tear thou keep'st me blind , 
 lest eye well-se thi foul fault should find . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 canst thou o cruel , say i love thee not , 
 when i against my self with thee partak ? 
 do i not think on thee when i forgot 
 am of my self , all-tyr , for thi sake ? 
 who hateth thee that i do call my friend , 
 on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon , 
 nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend 
 reveng upon my self with present moan ? 
 what merit do i in my self respect , 
 that is so proud thi servic to despis , 
 when all my best doth worship thi defect , 
 command by the motion of thine eye ? 
 but love hate on for now i know thi mind , 
 those that can see thou lov'st , and i am blind . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 o from what power hast thou thi power might , 
 with insuffici my heart to sway , 
 to make me give the lie to my true sight , 
 and swear that bright doth not grace the day ? 
 whenc hast thou thi becom of thing ill , 
 that in the veri refus of thi deed , 
 there is such strength and warrantis of skill , 
 that in my mind thi worst all best exce ? 
 who taught thee how to make me love thee more , 
 the more i hear and see just caus of hate ? 
 o though i love what other do abhor , 
 with other thou shouldst not abhor my state . 
 if thi unworthi rais love in me , 
 more worthi i to be belov of thee . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 love is too young to know what conscienc is , 
 yet who know not conscienc is born of love ? 
 then gentl cheater urg not my amiss , 
 lest guilti of my fault thi sweet self prove . 
 for thou betray me , i do betray 
 my nobler part to my gross bodi 's treason , 
 my soul doth tell my bodi that he may , 
 triumph in love , flesh stay no farther reason , 
 but rise at thi name doth point out thee , 
 as hi triumphant prize , proud of thi pride , 
 he is content thi poor drudg to be , 
 to stand in thi affair , fall by thi side . 
 no want of conscienc hold it that i call , 
 her love , for whose dear love i rise and fall . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 in love thee thou know'st i am forsworn , 
 but thou art twice forsworn to me love swear , 
 in act thi bed-vow broke and new faith torn , 
 in vow new hate after new love bear : 
 but whi of two oath ' breach do i accus thee , 
 when i break twenti ? i am perjur most , 
 for all my vow are oath but to misus thee : 
 and all my honest faith in thee is lost . 
 for i have sworn deep oath of thi deep kind : 
 oath of thi love , thi truth , thi constanc , 
 and to enlighten thee gave eye to blind , 
 or made them swear against the thing they see . 
 for i have sworn thee fair : more perjur i , 
 to swear against the truth so foul a be .

 cupid laid by hi brand and fell asleep , 
 a maid of dian 's thi advantag found , 
 and hi love-kindl fire did quickli steep 
 in a cold valley-fountain of that ground : 
 which borrow from thi holi fire of love , 
 a dateless live heat still to endur , 
 and grew a seet bath which yet men prove , 
 against strang maladi a sovereign cure : 
 but at my mistress ' eye love 's brand new-fir , 
 the boy for trial need would touch my breast , 
 i sick withal the help of bath desir , 
 and thither hie a sad distemp guest . 
 but found no cure , the bath for my help lie , 
 where cupid got new fire ; my mistress ' eye .

 laid by hi side hi heart-inflam brand , 
 whilst mani nymph that vow chast life to keep ,

 the fairest votari took up that fire , 
 which mani legion of true heart had warm , 
 and so the gener of hot desir , 
 wa sleep by a virgin hand disarm .

 which from love 's fire took heat perpetu , 
 grow a bath and health remedi , 
 for men discas , but i my mistress ' thrall , 
 came there for cure and thi by that i prove , 
 love 's fire heat water , water cool not love .
