the castaway < br > < br > < br > i < br > < br > when the cuban , led by gomez and maceo , were wage their final < br > rebellion against the immemori tyranni of spain , it may be recal < br > that there wa much filibust out of american port , and a live < br > demand for seafar men of an intrepid temper who could be reli on < br > to keep their eye open and their mouth shut . such a one wa young < br > captain o ’ shea , and , moreov , he wa no amateur at thi ticklish < br > industri , have alreadi “ jolt one president off hi perch in hayti , < br > and set fire to the coat-tail of anoth one in hondura , ” as he < br > explain to the swarthi gentlemen of the cuban junta in new york , who < br > pass on hi credenti . < br > < br > they gave him a sea-go tug call the _fearless_ , permit him to < br > pick hi own crew , and told him where to find hi cargo , in a fairli < br > lonesom inlet of the florida coast . thereaft he wa to work out < br > hi own salvat . the programm wa like to be anyth els than < br > monoton . to be nab by a yanke cruiser in home water for < br > break the law of nation meant that captain o ’ shea would cool hi < br > heel in a feder jail , a mishap most distast to a man of a rove < br > disposit . to run afoul of the spanish blockad fleet in cuban < br > water wa to be unceremoni shot full of hole and drown in the < br > bargain . < br > < br > such risk as these were incident to hi trade , and captain o ’ shea < br > maintain hi cheer composur until the _fearless_ had taken her < br > explos cargo on board and wa drop the sandi coast-lin of < br > florida over her stern . then he scrutin hi passeng and becam < br > annoy . the junta had sent him a cuban colonel and forti patriot , < br > recruit from the cigar factori of tampa and key west , who ardent , < br > even clamor , desir to return to their nativ land and fight for < br > the gloriou caus of liberti . < br > < br > their organ wa separ from that of the ship ’ s compani . it < br > wa not the busi of captain o ’ shea to enforc hi hard-fist < br > disciplin among them , nor did he have to feed them , for they had < br > brought their own store on board . earli in the voyag he express hi < br > superh opinion of the parti to the chief engin . the twain stood < br > on the littl bridg abov the wheel-hous , the clean-built , youth < br > irish-american skipper , and the beefi , gray-head johnni kent , whose < br > varieg career had begun among the yanke of ’ way down east . < br > < br > the deep-laden _fearless_ wa wallow through the uneasi sea of < br > the gulf stream . the cuban patriot were alreadi sea-sick in squad , < br > and they lay helpless amid an amaz disord of weapon , blanket , < br > haversack , valis , and cloth . now and then the crest of a sea < br > flick merrili over the low guard-rail and swash across the pallid < br > suffer . < br > < br > “ did ye ever see such a mess in all your born day ? ” disgustedli < br > observ captain o ’ shea . “ and we will have to live with thi menageri < br > for a week or so , johnny. ” < br > < br > “ it ’ ll be a whole lot wors when all of ’ em are took sea-sick , ” wa the < br > discourag repli . “ doggon ’ em , they ain ’ t even stow their kit < br > away . they just flop and die in their track . whi don ’ t you make < br > their colonel kick some savvey into ’ em , eh , cap ’ n mike ? ” < br > < br > “ colonel calvo ? ” and o ’ shea spat to leeward with a laugh . “ he is < br > curl up in the spare state-room , and hi complexion is as green as a < br > starboard light . there is one american in the lot . wait till i fetch < br > him up. ” < br > < br > a deck-hand wa sent into the dismal chao , and there present < br > return in hi wake a lean , sandi man in khaki who clutch an < br > old-fashion springfield rifl . at a guess hi year might have been < br > forti , and hi visag had never a trace of humor in it . much drill had < br > squar hi shoulder and flatten hi back , and he stiffli salut < br > captain o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ who are you , and what are ye do in such amazin ’ bad compani ? ” ask < br > the latter . < br > < br > “ my name is jack gorham , sir . i serv four enlist in the fifth < br > infantri , and i have medal for marksmanship . the cuban took me on as < br > a sharp-shoot . they promis me a thousand dollar for everi spanish < br > offic i pick off with thi old gun of mine . i have a hundr and < br > fifti round . you can figur it out for yourself , sir . i ’ ll be a rich < br > man. ” < br > < br > “ provid ye are not pick off first , me hope sharp-shoot . are < br > there ani more good men in your crowd ? ” < br > < br > the old regular dubious shook hi head as he answer : < br > < br > “ there ’ s a dozen or so that may qualifi on dri land . the rest ain ’ t < br > what you ’ d call reliabl comrades-in-arms. ” < br > < br > “ oh , they may buck up , ” exclaim captain o ’ shea . “ look here , gorham , < br > you can ’ t live on deck with those sea-sick swine . better go for ’ ard and < br > bunk with my crew. ” < br > < br > jack gorham look grate , but firmli declar : < br > < br > “ thank you , sir , i belong with the cuban outfit , and i ’ ll take my < br > medicin . it would make bad feel if i wa to quit ’ em . they are as < br > jealou and touchi as children . i have a tip for you . there is one ugli < br > lad in the bunch , the big , black nigger settin ’ yonder on the hatch . < br > they tell me he come from colombia and left there two jump ahead of < br > the police. ” < br > < br > they gaze down at the power figur of the negro , whose tatter < br > shirt disclos swell ridg of muscl and more than one long < br > scar defin in pink against the shine black skin . thick-lip , < br

prick < br > up hi ear . < br > < br > “ rais a row about the grub , is he ? ’ ti a piti he could not be < br > sea-sick earli and often. ” < br > < br > “ whi don ’ t you crack him over the head with a belayin ’ -pin just for < br > luck ? ” amiabl suggest the chief engin . “ it would sweeten him up < br > considerable. ” < br > < br > “ i am carri them as passeng , you blood-thirsti old buccan , ” < br > retort o ’ shea . “ i must keep me hand off till they realli mix thing < br > up . but i do not like the look of the big nigger . he is one of your < br > born trouble-hunters. ” < br > < br > “ you take my advic and beat him up good and plenti befor he get < br > start , ” wa the sage farewel of johnni kent as he lumber below to < br > exhort hi oiler and stoker . < br > < br > the night came down and obscur the hurri tug whose cours wa laid < br > for the yucatan passag around the western end of cuba . the light of a < br > merchant-steam twinkl far distant and captain o ’ shea sheer off to < br > give her a wide berth . he had no desir to be sight or report . < br > < br > to him , keep lookout on the darken bridg , came hi cook , a < br > peaceabl mulatto who had a grievanc which he air as follow : < br > < br > “ pleas , cap ’ n , them cuban what ain ’ t sea-sick is actin ’ power < br > unreason . i let ’ em heat their stuff and make coffe in my < br > galley , but i ain ’ t ’ sponsibl for th ’ ration they all draw . that < br > big , black niggah is stirrin ’ ’ em up . jiminez , they call him . at < br > supper-tim to-night , cap ’ n , he tri to swipe some of th

need everi pound of them . i will see to it that your galley < br > isn ’ t raid . and if thi big bucko jiminez get gay again , give him < br > the tea-kettl and scald the black hide off him -- understand ? ” < br > < br > “ ye , suh , cap ’ n ; i ’ ll parboil him if you ’ ll look out he don ’ t carv me < br > when he ’ s done recuperated. ” < br > < br > the cook descend to hi realm of pot and pan while captain < br > o ’ shea reflect that the voyag might be even liveli than he had < br > anticip . with calm weather hi forti passeng would recov their < br > appetit and demand three meal per day . they might whine and grumbl < br > over the shortag , but without a leader they were fairli harmless . < br > < br > “ i will have to lock horn with the big nigger befor he get ani more < br

took hold of the reviv patriot , who aros from the < br > coal-sack and crowd to the galley window . the cook toil with one < br > eye warili lift lest the formid negro from colombia should board < br

eager to encount the < br > rough-and-tumbl deck-hand of the _fearless_ , besid which the < br > prudent cook hover within easi distanc of the steam tea-kettl . < br > < br > to the amus of captain o ’ shea , it wa that lathi sharp-shoot of < br > the seriou counten , jack gorham , who took it upon himself to read < br > the riot act to the big negro . he regard himself and hi duti with a < br > profound , unshaken graviti . jiminez overtop him by a foot , but pride < br > of race and self-respect would not permit him to knuckl under to the < br > black bulli . < br > < br > “ will ye look at the gorham man ? ” said captain o ’ shea to the chief < br > engin who had join him . “ he is bristlin ’ up to the nigger like a < br > terrier pup . and jiminez would make no more than two bite of him. ” < br > < br > “ how can the soldier do anyth els ? ” exclaim johnni kent . “ he ’ s < br > the onli white man in the bunch. ” < br > < br > “ i may as well let him know that i am backin ’ hi

fail to respond to the captain ’ s < br > greet smile . < br > < br > “ unless i am mistaken , gorham , ye have it in mind to tackl a job that < br > look a coupl of size too larg for you . will ye start a ruction with < br > jiminez ? ” < br > < br > “ until the colonel get on hi leg i ’ m the man to take charg of the < br > parti , sir , ” answer the soldier , reflect rub the bald spot < br > which shone through hi thin thatch of sandi hair . < br > < br > “ but i expect to take a hand , ” petulantli declar the captain . “ thi < br > is my ship. ” < br > < br > “ excus me , sir , ” and gorham ’ s accent were most apologet . “ thi < br > is your ship , but it ain ’ t your parti . the patriot are a separ < br > command . the big nigger belong to me . if i don ’ t discourag him , i <

a relentless foe and show him no merci . < br > feebli move hi hand , he turn a ghastli face to the visitor and < br > croak : < br > < br > “ i have no inter ’ in my men , in my countri , in noth at all . i am < br > dread sick . i will not live to see my cuba . she will weep for me . < br > the ship , she will sink pretti soon ? i hope so. ” < br > < br > “ nonsens , colonel , ” bluffli return o ’ shea . “ the weather couldn ’ t be < br > finer . a few day more of thi and ye will be wade in spanish gore to < br > your boot-top . i want to ask about your store . your men are growlin ’ . < br > who is in charg of the commissari ? ” < br > < br > “ talk to me noth about eat , ” moan the suffer . “ whi do anybodi < br > want eat ? come to-morrow , nex ’ day , nex ’ week . now i have the wish to < br > die with peace. ” < br > < br > “ the sooner , the better , ” said the visitor , and depart . < br > < br > the _fearless_ , with explos in the hold and inflamm human < br > above-deck , pursu her hard-driven way through anoth night and < br > turn to doubl cape san antonio and enter the stori water of < br > the caribbean . black jiminez had fail to play the rôle expect of < br > him and the discont of the patriot focuss itself in no open < br > outbreak . captain o ’ shea wa puzzl at thi until the mate came to < br > him and announc that the cuban had broken through a bulkhead in the < br > after-hold and were steal the ship ’ s store . thi account for < br > their good behavior on deck . the leader of the secret raid parti wa < br > the big negro from colombia . < br > < br > “ it seem to me that thi is _my_ busi , ” softli quoth the skipper , < br > and hi gray eye danc while he pull hi belt a notch tighter . “ but < br > i must play fair and ask permiss of the melancholi sharp-shoot < br > befor i proceed to make a vacanc in the jiminez family. ” < br > < br > the interview with gorham wa brief . the captain argu that by < br > break through a bulkhead and pilfer the crew ’ s provis , the < br > larg black one had invad the o ’ shea domain . the soldier held to it < br > with the stubborn of a wooden indian that hi own self-respect wa < br > at stake . o ’ shea lost hi temper and burst out : < br > < br > “ if ye are so damn anxiou to commit suicid , go and get him and put < br > him in iron . i will give you a decent burial at sea , though ye don ’ t < br > deserv it , you pig-head old ramrod. ” < br > < br > “ the moral effect will be better if i get him , ” mildli suggest the < br > soldier . < br > < br > the cuban had learn that troubl wa in the wind . their stolen < br > suppli were to be cut off and thi meant short ration again . angri < br > and rebelli , onli a spark wa need to set them ablaz . when eight < br > bell struck the noon hour they surg toward the galley , make a < br > great nois , display their sea-rust machet and rifl . in the < br > lead wa jiminez , a half-clad , barbar giant who wave a heavi blade < br > over hi head and shout imprec . the purpos of the mob wa to < br > rush the galley and carri off all the food in sight . < br > < br > the crew of the _fearless_ like not the idea of go dinnerless . when < br > the excit patriot charg forward , there quickli ralli in front of < br > the deck-hous fourteen earnest-look men equip with mauser rifl < br > broken out of the cargo . in a wheel-hous window appear the head < br > and shoulder of captain o ’ shea . hi fist held a piec of artilleri < br > known as a colt ’ s forty-f . in the background of the pictur wa < br > the resourc johnni kent , who wa coupl the brass nozzl of the < br > fire-hos . < br > < br > jiminez had decid to declar war . he appeal to the patriot to < br > use their weapon , but they show a prudent reluct to open the < br > engag . one of them , by way of locat the respons for the < br > disput , pull a revolv from a holster and took a snap-shot at the < br > cook . < br > < br > “ i guess i ’ d better turn loos thi hose and wash ’ em aft , cap ’ n mike , ” < br > sung out the chief engin . “ georg is a darn good cook and it < br > ain ’ t right to let these black-and-tan pester him. ” < br > < br > captain o ’ shea bound from the bridg to the deck , and the crew of < br > the _fearless_ welcom him with joyou yelp . instead of give them < br > the expect order to charg the cuban hammer-and-tong , he made for < br > jiminez single-hand . hi intent wa thwart . between him and < br > the burli negro appear the spare figur of jack gorham , who move < br > swiftli , quietli . with courteou inton and no sign of heat he < br > affirm : < br > < br > “ thi is my job , sir . it ’ s about time to put a few kink in him. ” < br > < br > the manner of the man made captain o ’ shea hesit and feel rebuk , < br > as though he had been properli told to mind hi own busi . with a < br > boyish grin he slap gorham on the back and said : < br > < br > “ i beg your pardon for intrudin ’ . ’ ti your funeral. ” < br > < br > although the mob behind jiminez fail to catch the word of thi bit < br > of dialogu , they comprehend it import . the extraordinari composur < br > of the two men impress them . they felt more fear of them than of the < br > embattl deck-hand . the tableau last onli a moment , but a singular < br > silenc fell upon the ship . < br > < br > big jiminez nervous lick hi lip and hi bloodshot eye rove < br > uneasili . it wa appar that he had been singl out as the leader , < br > and that the sad-featur american soldier in the sea-stain khaki < br > view him as no more than an incid in the day ’ s work . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea had step back to join hi own men . jack gorham stood < br > alon in a small clear space of the deck , face the trucul negro . < br > the cuban began to edg away from jiminez as if comprehend that < br > here wa an issu between two men . the soldier had for a weapon that < br > belov old springfield rifl , but he made no motion to shoot . < br > < br > present he sprang forward , with the heavi butt uprais . the negro < br > swung hi machet at the same instant and the blade wa parri < br > by the steel barrel . the mob had becom an audienc . it lost it < br > menac solidar and drift a littl way aft to make room for < br > the combat . instead of riot or mutini , the troubl on board the < br > _fearless_ had defin itself as a duel . < br > < br > the veteran regular handl the club rifl with amaz eas and < br > dexter . the wick machet could not beat down hi guard , and he < br > stood hi ground , shift , duck , weav in and out , watch for < br > an open to smash the negro ’ s face with a thrust of the butt . onc < br > the blade nick gorham ’ s shoulder and a red smear spread over the < br > khaki tunic . < br > < br > jiminez wa forc back until he wa cramp for room to swing . hi < br > machet rang against a metal stanchion and the galley window wa at < br > hi elbow . hi black skin shine with sweat , hi breath labor , the < br > splendid brute wa begin to realiz that he had met hi master . < br > from the tail of hi eye he observ that the cuban no longer < br > throng the passageway between the deck-hous and guard-rail . he < br > turn and ran toward the stern . < br > < br > gorham wa after him like a shot . in hi wake scamper the crew of < br > the _fearless_ intermingl with the cuban , all anxiou to be in at < br > the finish . jiminez wheel where the deck wa wide . he wa not as < br > formid as at first . fear wa in hi heart . he had never fought < br > such a man as thi insignificant-look american soldier , who wa < br > unterrifi , unconquer . gorham ran at him without an instant ’ s < br > hesit , the rifl grip for a downward swing . the machet graze < br > hi head and chip the skin from the bald spot . < br > < br > befor jiminez could strike again , the butt smote hi thick skull and < br > he stagger backward . caught off hi balanc , hi machet no longer < br > danger , he wa unabl to avoid the next assault . gorham move a step < br > nearer and deftli tap hi adversari with the rifle-butt . it wa a < br > knock-out blow deliv with the measur precis of a prize-r < br > artist . the machet drop from the negro ’ s limp finger and he < br > toppl across two sack of coal with a sigh grunt . < br > < br > the crew of the _fearless_ broke into a cheer . the mate on duti in < br > the wheel-hous let the vessel steer herself and scrambl to the < br > bridg , where he wa clumsili danc a jig . the cuban chatter among < br > themselv in subdu accent , and from the state-room door peer < br > the wan counten of colonel calvo , who wa wring hi hand and < br > sputter command to which nobodi paid the slightest attent . < br > < br > jack gorham stood sway slightli , lean upon hi springfield , and < br > wipe the blood from hi eye with the back of hi hand . a moment later < br > captain o ’ shea had both arm around him and wa bellow in hi ear : < br > < br > “ we will hoist ye into a bunk , jack . oh , but you are the jewel of a < br > fightin ’ man ! i hope ye were not hurt bad. ” < br > < br > “ noth to speak of , sir , but my wind isn ’ t what it wa , ” pant < br > gorham . “ better look after the nigger first . i didn ’ t plan to kill him. ” < br > < br > the chief engin wa drag the hose aft with the praiseworthi < br > intent of wash down the combat , and the captain told him to < br > turn the cool salt-wat on the prostrat bulk of the negro . < br > < br > “ i ’ ll play nurs to him if you haven ’ t spoil him entir , ” said < br > johnni kent . “ i need more help down below and he ’ ll make a dandi hand < br > with a coal-shovel when hi head is mended. ” < br > < br > just then the mate , who had return to the wheel , yell to captain < br > o ’ shea and jerk the whistle-cord . the skipper ran forward and bolt < br > into the wheel-hous . with a flourish of hi arm the mate indic a < br > small boat lift and fall on the azur swell no more than a few < br > hundr yard beyond the bow of the tug . the occup were vigor < br > signal by mean of uprais oar and articl of cloth . < br > < br > the captain rang the engine-room bell to slacken speed and stare at < br > the boat-load of castaway which had none of the ear-mark of shipwreck < br > and suffer . the white paint of the boat wa unmar by the sea < br > and the handsom brass fit were bright . two seamen in white < br > cloth were at the oar , and in the stern-sheet were two women and < br > a young man who could not be mistaken for the ordinari voyag of a < br > trading-vessel ’ s cabin . < br > < br > “ i ought to have call you sooner , sir , ” sheepishli confess the mate < br > of the _fearless_ , “ but i wa watch the shindi on deck , same as all < br > hand of us . what do you make of it ? ” < br > < br > “ it look like a pleasur parti , ” said captain o ’ shea . “ i am puzzl < br > for fair. ” < br > < br > he order the engin stop and the _fearless_ drift slowli toward < br > the boat . the ship ’ s compani flock to the rail to see the castaway , < br > who gaze in their turn at the picturesqu throng of twentieth-centuri < br > buccan -- the swarthi , unshaven cuban with their flap straw < br > hat , bright handkerchief knot at the throat , their waist gird < br > with cartridge-belt , holster , and machete-scabbard -- and the < br > sunburnt , reckless rascal of the crew . < br > < br > there were symptom of constern in the small boat as it danc < br > nearer the crowd rail of the _fearless_ , also percept less < br > eager to be rescu . thi wa make a choic between the devil < br > and the deep sea . it wa now possibl to discern that of the two women < br > in the stern of the boat one wa elderli and the other girlishli < br > youth . both wore white shirt-waist and duck skirt , and the young < br > man wa smartli attir in a blue double-breast coat , of a nautic < br > cut , and flannel trouser . one might have suppos that the parti wa < br > be set ashor from a yacht instead of toss adrift in a lone < br > stretch of the caribbean beyond sight of land . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea survey them with a dismay air . he wa not equip < br > for the busi of rescu shipwreck peopl of such fashion < br > appear ; and as for take two women on board the _fearless_ , here < br > wa a complic to vex the soul of an industri , single-mind < br > filibust . howev , he wa a sailor and an irishman , and hi honest < br > heart respond to the appeal of feminin in distress . the step were < br > hung over the tug ’ s side to make the transfer from the boat as easi as < br > possibl , and a deck-hand stood readi with a coil of heaving-lin . from < br > the bridg captain o ’ shea hail the derelict . < br > < br > “ for the love of heaven , who are you and where do ye come from , so < br > spick and span ? what is it all about , anyhow ? ” < br > < br > the young man in the stern answer in somewhat nettl tone : < br > < br > “ it seem more to the point to ask who you are . we are in a deucedli < br > bad fix , and these ladi ought to be taken aboard ; but do you mind if < br > i ask whether you intend to make us walk the plank ? my word , but you < br > are a fright hard-look lot . is captain kidd with you ? ” < br > < br > it wa o ’ shea ’ s turn to be ruffl , and he flung back : < br > < br > “ you seem mighti particular about your compani . ’ ti a nuisanc for me < br > to bother with ye at all. ” < br > < br > “ oh , the ladi can ’ t drift about in thi open boat ani longer , ” the < br > young man hasten to exclaim . “ i shall pay you handsom to set us < br > ashor at the nearest port. ” < br > < br > “ and what would i be do in the nearest port ? ” the skipper mutter < br > with a grin . “ well , there is no sens in slingin ’ word to and fro . let < br > them come aboard and find out for themselves. ” < br > < br > run to the rail to assist these unwelcom guest , he call to the < br > self-possess young man in the boat : < br > < br > “ how long have ye been adrift ? ” < br > < br > “ sinc midnight . our yacht ran on a reef and broke her back . befor < br > daylight we lost sight of the other boats. ” < br > < br > captain o ’ shea said noth more . hi interest veer to the girl , < br > who had been shield her face from the blister glare of sun and < br > sea . now , as she look up at the tug which tower abov the boat , < br > the impression skipper perceiv that her face wa fair to see , < br > and that she smile at him with friendli confid . present he wa < br > lend her a steadi hand as she clung to the sway rail of the < br > tug and found foothold on the step over which the wave wash . < br > < br > “ you are a plucki one and no mistak ! ” exclaim captain o ’ shea . “ a < br > man might think ye enjoy it. ” < br > < br > “ i do , ” said she , shake the water from her skirt as she gain the < br > deck . “ now pleas get my aunt aboard as care as you can . she ha a < br > touch of rheumatism. ” < br > < br > without mishap the elderli ladi wa assist to accomplish the < br > acrobat feat of forsak the bob boat , after which the young < br > man and the sailor were allow to shift for themselv . leather < br > hand-bag , steamer-rug , and can provis were toss to the deck < br > and the boat wa turn adrift , for there wa no room to stow it on < br > board . immedi the _fearless_ forg ahead and pick up her cours < br > at full speed . < br > < br > to an elderli spinster of refin whose year had been spent in a < br > shelter , effet civil , mostli bound by massachusett , the < br > deck of the _fearless_ wa an environ shock beyond word . the < br > chief engin had resum hi interrupt task of play the hose < br > on the senseless , half-nak bulk of black jiminez . jack gorham , more < br > or

in the refug of the captain ’ s room that distraught spinster , miss < br > hollist , wa overcom by emot almost hyster . her first < br > impress of the _fearless_ had been in the natur of a nervou

began , spur by the prompt of a new england conscienc . < br > < br > “ and what wa that slipperi divil of a cook deludin ’ ye about ? ” < br > < br > the spinster muster courag to explain . captain o

nora ’ s mirth comment . < br > < br > “ we are in the captain ’ s power , ” sigh miss hollist . < br > < br > “ we are kidnap . that ’ s what it amount to , ” strenuous affirm van < br > steen . < br

found two batter wooden chair and < br > rig an awn . such consider as thi wa bound to dull the < br > edg of miss hollist ’ s fear and she gaze about her with flutter < br > interest and reviv anim . through an open door they could < br > see captain o ’ shea stand besid the man at the wheel . he wore no < br > coat , hi shirt-sleev were roll up and display hi brown , sinewi < br > forearm , and a shapeless straw hat wa pull over hi eye . hi < br > binocular attent swept the blue horizon ahead and abeam . < br > < br > present he went on the bridg and search the shimmer sea astern . < br > hi

had < br > attract the captain ’ s notic . at length he wa abl to make out a < br > trail wisp of brown vapor , like a bit of cloud , where sea and sky < br > met . < br > < br > “ there is some kind of a steamer astern of us , ” said van steen to nora < br > forb . “ perhap it is a german or english mail-boat . if so , i can see < br > no object to transfer us aboard. ” < br > < br > captain o ’ shea overheard the remark and call to them : < br > < br > “ no mail-steam is due on thi cours . and it is not a cargo tramp or < br > she would not be steam faster than we are. ” < br > < br > “ then what can it be ? ” ask nora . < br > < br > “ i can not tell ye , miss forb , nor am i anxiou at all to let her come < br > close enough to find out. ” < br > < br > on the lower deck the cuban were flock to the overhang or climb < br > on the rail to gaze at the distant smoke astern . they talk excitedli , < br > with mani gestur . evid here wa an event of some import . < br > littl by littl the other steamer cut down the mile of interven < br > space until her funnel wa visibl . the _fearless_ had been make no < br > unusu effort to increas her own speed , but now captain o ’ shea said < br

to join the blockadin ’ fleet and make < br > it hot for our busi . there is noth on the coast that can do over < br > twelv knot , is there ? ” < br > < br > “ onli the _julio sanchez_ , cap ’ n mike

there wa someth < br > said about a reward of fifti thousand dollar to the spanish navi < br > vessel that overhaul the _fearless_ and sunk her at sea . better crack < br > on steam and mayb we can lose that fellow yonder after nightfall. ” < br > < br > “ aye , aye , cap ’ n mike , i ’ ll put the clamp on the safety-valv , and < br > take care not to look at the gaug . i ’ ll need more help below. ” < br > < br > “ grab the deck-hand . get to it. ” < br > < br > “ and i wa just crawlin ’ into my bunk to finish the most excitin ’ novel < br > you ever read , ” mourn johnni kent as he foot it down the ladder . < br > “ it ’ s all about adventur . the situat are hair-raisin ’ , cap ’ n < br > mike. ” < br > < br > young mr. van steen had edg within ear-shot so that he heard part < br > of thi dialogu . return to the ladi , he thrust hi hand in < br > hi pocket and tri to hide hi perturb . nora question him < br > eagerli , and he answer with a shrug and a laugh : < br > < br > “ we

safety-valv . < br > that is absurd , of cours . the boiler might blow up. ” < br > < br > “ i am inclin to think he meant it , ” said nora , who wa look at < br > captain o ’ shea . “ thi is not a yacht cruis , gerald. ” < br > < br > “ but if the silli old ass of an engin realli meant it , and we are < br > pursu by a hostil man-of-war , ” stubbornli persist van steen , “ whi < br > did he talk about want to finish a novel becaus it wa full of < br > excit adventur ? isn ’ t thi excit enough ? ” < br > < br > “ you are stupid , ” impati exclaim nora . “ these extraordinari men < br > can ’ t see that they are live the most thrill adventur . it is all < br > in the day ’ s work with them . i am go to ask captain o ’ shea to tell < br > me the truth. ” < br > < br > her aunt object , but with no great spirit . her poor , tire brain < br > wa bewild by thi new turn of event . she had begun to hope to < br > surviv the voyag , but now she wa beset by fresh alarm , fantast < br > and incred . immin danger menac the lawless tug . it could be < br > felt in the buzz excit which pervad the crowd deck . the < br > onli calm place wa the bridg , where captain o ’ shea walk steadili to < br > and fro , six pace to port and six pace to starboard , a rag cigar < br > between hi teeth . alreadi the hull wa vibrat to the increas < br > speed of the engin and the smoke gush thick and black from the hot < br > funnel . < br > < br > nora forb had mount the bridg befor van steen could make angri < br > protest . cling to the canvas-screen rail , she paus to catch a < br > bird ’ s-ey glimps of the swarm deck which spread beneath her from < br > the sheer bow to the overhang that seem level with the follow < br > sea . captain o ’ shea snatch a coat from the wheel-hous and flung it < br > over the girl ’ s head and shoulder , for the red cinder were pelt < br > down from the funnel-top like hail . for the life of him he could not < br > keep the caress note out of hi pleasant voic when he wa talk < br > to a pretti woman . < br > < br > “ ’ ti a bright day and a fine breez , miss forb , and the old < br > _fearless_ is poundin ’ through it at thirteen knot . are ye enjoy < br > yourself ? ” < br > < br > “ everi minut of it , ” she repli , and the joy of live made her cheek < br > glow . “ are you realli afraid of that steamer behind us ? mr. van steen < br > thought you were joke with the chief engin . realli you can be < br > frank with me . i promis not to make a scene. ” < br > < br > he regard her rather wist for an instant , felt unusu < br > hesit , and told her the truth becaus he could not bring himself to < br > tell her anyth els . < br > < br > “ if it is a spanish cruiser yonder , as i mistrust , she may make short < br > work of us . but she ha to catch us first . and if i wa easi to catch < br > i would not be here at all . sooner than risk a hair of your head , miss < br > forb , i would give up meself and my ship . but a man ’ s duti come < br > first. ” < br > < br > “ you are not to give me -- to give us , one thought , ” she warmli assur < br > him , and her head wa held high . “ thank you for be honest with me , < br > captain o ’ shea . do you wish us to stay on deck ? ” < br > < br > perplex and unhappi , he answer : < br > < br > “ there is no safe place to stow you if the spaniard get within < br > shoot rang . the hold is full of cartridg and dynamit and such < br > skittish truck. ” < br > < br > the steamer astern wa still slowli gain on the _fearless_ . her < br > forward mast wa now discern , and the tini ring around it wa < br > unmistak a fighting-top . if the vessel belong to ani other < br > navi than that of spain , she would be jog along at a cruis < br > gait , instead of crowd in chase with a reckless consumpt of < br > coal . captain o ’ shea ran below to see how matter fare in the sooti , < br > stifl kingdom of johnni kent . the _fearless_ could not turn and < br > fight . all hope of safeti were bound up in those clank , throb , < br > shine engin , in the hiss boiler , in the gang of half-nak , < br > grimi men who fed the rage furnac and wield the glow < br > slice-bar and shift the coal from the cavern bunker . < br > < br > the quiver needl of the gaug alreadi record more steam than < br > the law allow , and they were creep higher pound by pound . the < br > heat in the fire-room wa so intens that the men had to be reliev < br > at brief interv . there wa no forc ventil , and the wind wa < br > follow the ship . the deck-hand , unaccustom to grill aliv , < br

oil-can in one < br > hand , a heavi wrench in the other , and with the latter he smote such < br > faint-heart wight as would falter while there wa strength in them . < br > < br > “ hello , cap ’ n mike , ” he roar as the skipper sidl into the < br > engine-room . “ is the other vessel still gainin ’ on us , and what doe < br > she look like ? ” < br > < br > “ she look like troubl , johnni . we

” < br > < br > captain o ’ shea hasten on deck , glanc forward and aft , and grin < br > as he caught sight of gerald ten eyck van steen . to thi pamper < br > young man he shout : < br > < br > “ you are a well-built lad . jump below , if you pleas , and the chief < br > will introduc ye to a shovel. ” < br > < br > “ but i don ’ t want a shovel . i refus to go below , ” haughtili repli < br > van steen . “ it ha occur to me that if you will quit thi silli race < br > and let the other steamer come within signal distanc i can explain < br > the case to her command , and he will be glad to take us on board . van < br > steen & van steen have influenti bank connect with the spanish < br > government. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti no time to deliv orat , ” swiftli spake o ’ shea . “ the other <

play the game , ” slangili advis nora forb . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea did not appear to use violenc . he seem to propel van < br > steen with a careless wave of the arm , and the indign young man < br > move rapidli in the direct of the stoke-hol ladder . johnni kent < br > pounc on him with profan jubil , instantli strip him of coat < br > and shirt , and shot him in to join the pant toiler . there wa a < br > plucki streak in thi victim of circumst , and he perceiv that he < br > must take hi medicin . the fire-room gang wa reinforc by a strong < br > pair of arm , a stout back , and the stubborn endur of the dutch . < br > < br > the afternoon wa gone and the sun had slid under the love western < br > sea . the spanish cruiser wa spurt desper to overtak her < br > quarri befor dark . the speed of the quiver , clangor < br > _fearless_ had crept up to a shade better than fifteen knot . the < br > cruiser wa in poor trim to show what she could do . captain o ’ shea knew < br > the rate speed of everi craft on the spanish naval list and if hi < br > surmis wa correct thi particular cruiser should be do eighteen < br > knot . but he knew also that a foul bottom , slovenli disciplin , and < br > inferior coal count against her , and that he had a fight chanc of < br > escap . < br > < br > it wa immens tri to watch and wait . of all the compani on deck < br > that stood and stare at the small outlin of the cruiser etch < br > against the shine sea , onli captain o ’ shea realiz that thi wa < br > the grimmest kind of a life-and-death tussl . he wa your thoroughbr < br > gambler who comprehend the odd and accept them , but he wa sorri for < br > hi crew , and much more so for the two women who were in hi charg . < br > < br > the chaperon had retir to her room in the grip of an acut nervou < br > headach . she wa merci unabl to understand that tragedi move < br > on the face of the water , that whether or not the _fearless_ wa to < br > be obliter depend on a certain number of engin revolut per < br > minut . < br > < br > the cook had prepar supper , observ to himself as he rattl hi < br > pan : < br > < br > “ if we all is due to git bump to glori , i reckon we ’ ll take it more < br > cheer with a squar meal under our briskets. ” < br > < br > he duti bore a tray to the captain ’ s room , but miss hollist had < br > no appetit , and he betook himself to the bridg , where nora forb wa < br > stand besid the captain . < br > < br > “ set the supper on the chart-lock in the wheel-hous , georg , ” said < br > o ’ shea . “ the young ladi will not be want to go into her room and < br > miss ani of the show. ” < br > < br > in her twenti year nora forb had never live as intens as < br > now . the blood of an adventur ancestri wa in her vein . she wa < br > thrill , but not afraid . more than she wa awar , the domin < br > person of captain o ’ shea wa influenc and attract her . < br > unconsci she wa share hi simpl , clear-ey courag , which < br > accept thing as he found them . there wa singular comfort in < br > stand besid him . they linger for a moment in the wheel-hous , < br > where the tall young mate grip the spoke , hi eye fix on the < br > sway compass-card in the binnacl . < br > < br > “ you have never filibust befor , i take it , miss forb , ” said < br > captain o ’ shea , “ but ye are as cool as an old hand. ” < br > < br > “ i never dream that men were live such live as thi nowaday , ” she < br > repli . “ tell me , do you -- -- ” < br > < br > down the wind came the report of a heavi gun . o ’ shea leap to the < br > bridg and the girl follow , her heart throb with a sudden , < br > sicken fear . twilight wa shut down . the first star gleam in < br > the pale sky , but a curiou after-glow linger to flood the sea with < br > tremul illumin . the cruiser show like a gray shadow , a vagu < br > blur , from which shot a second flash of red . again the boom of her gun < br > wa heard on the _fearless_ , and thi time the steel shell kick up a < br > water-spout far off to starboard . < br > < br > “ johnni kent ha lost distanc in the last half hour , ” mutter the < br > skipper . “ hi men can ’ t stand the pace. ” < br > < br > “ what doe it mean ? ” implor nora , and she caught her breath with a < br > sob . “ are they realli and truli tri to kill us ? ” < br > < br > “ those are the intent , but the shoot is pretti bad , miss forb . < br > i will bet ye ten to one they do not hit us. ” < br > < br > unwittingli she move closer to him . her hand wa upon the rail and he < br > cover it with hi hard palm . at the firm , warm contact her fortitud < br > return . hi tremend vital wa like an electr current . she < br > smile up at him grate , and he said in a big , friendli way , to put < br > her at eas : < br > < br > “ ’ ti good to have somebodi to hang onto in a tight pinch , isn ’ t it ? < br > look ! there he goe again ! a better shot . it struck the water within < br > two hundr yard of us . if he keep on improvin ’ hi target practic , < br > i may lose me bet. ” < br > < br > nora wa silent . she could think of noth to say as she stare at the < br > darken horizon and the flash of the cruiser ’ s gun . the after-glow < br > die , and night march swiftli across the tropic sea . it curtain < br > the cruiser and obscur the _fearless_ . johnni kent had won in the < br > first act of the drama . < br > < br > everi light on board the tug wa extinguish , and the word wa carri < br > below to close the draught and slacken the fire in order to show no < br > spark from the funnel . the _fearless_ swerv sharpli from her cours < br > and ran straight away from the cuban coast , head to the southward < br > across the caribbean . to follow her wa a game of blind-man ’ s-buff , and < br > captain o ’ shea knew everi trick of shake off pursuit . < br > < br > nora had withdrawn her imprison hand with a self-consci littl < br > start . alreadi the episod of the chase seem unreal , theatric . < br > it would not have surpris her if the picturesqu cuban had burst < br > into a light-opera choru . she hasten to tell her aunt the good < br > news , and present there came stagger up from the lower deck the < br > wreck of gerald ten eyck van steen . the merci night hid hi grime < br > and tatter . lean against the bulkhead of the tini passageway , he < br > address the invis ladi in the state-room . hi voic wa huski < br > and crack , but , singularli enough , all it petul had fled . < br > < br > “ it wa simpli great , ” he exclaim . “ we shovel coal like drunken < br > devil , and between-tim they drag us on deck and turn the hose < br > on us . my word , it wa a sporti game , and we won . i am bruis from < br > head to foot , but what ’ s the odd ? ” < br > < br > nora wa instantli contrit . here wa an unexpect hero , whom she had < br > shame forgotten . < br > < br > “ you poor gerald ! tell us all about it. ” < br > < br > he felt proud of himself . nora share the feel , and yet her behavior < br > lack the warmth to be expect of a girl whose engag to gerald < br > van steen had been a notabl societi event on fifth avenu . wayward and < br > shock it wa , no doubt , but she knew that she would rather talk to < br > the rude and unregener captain michael o ’ shea . < br > < br > she let gerald tell her of the great fight for more speed down among < br > the roar furnac , of the faint men , the strain boiler , the < br > furious driven engin , and of the bulli , curs , jest johnni < br > kent who held the men and the machin unfalteringli to their work . < br > < br > “ he is an aw brute , ” said van steen , rub a welt on hi shoulder , < br > “ but he ha pluck -- no end of it . a steam-pip lead to a pump or < br > someth burst and scald him , but he didn ’ t let up at all , and < br > threaten us with more kind of death and damnat than ever. ” < br > < br > “ he must be suffer dread , ” exclaim the ardent sympathet < br > nora . “ i thought he look so good-natur and jolli and easy-going. ” < br > < br > “ you are a poor hand at read charact , ” wa the earnest comment . < br > “ were you anxiou about me , nora ? ” < br > < br > “ ye , i suppos so . it wa so excit on deck that i couldn ’ t think of < br > anyth els but that wick spanish cruiser. ” < br > < br > “ where were you all the time ? ” < br > < br > “ on the bridg with captain o ’ shea. ” < br > < br > “ the deuc you were ! i don ’ t like him at all , nora . he is not the sort < br > you should have anyth to do with. ” < br > < br > “ i can ’ t veri well help meet him now and then , gerald . don ’ t be a < br > goos . tell me some more about your adventur with a shovel. ” < br > < br > van steen wa ruffl and becam a sulki companion . nora let him kiss < br > her good-night , and he wearili descend to find a resting-plac on the < br > open deck . she found her aunt awak and told her of the heroic conduct < br > of the scald chief engin . the stamp of van steen ’ s approv wa < br > apt to color the mental attitud of miss hollist and she exclaim in < br > an anim manner : < br > < br > “ doe gerald realli believ that thi mr. kent is such a fine < br > charact , a diamond in the rough ? ” < br > < br > “ gerald certainli respect him , although he doe not love him , aunt < br > katharine. ” < br > < br > “ then i hope to meet mr. kent in the morn , nora . i am given to < br > understand that he save our live , but i can ’ t realiz that the < br > cruiser wa actual shoot at us with deadli intent. ” < br > < br > miss hollist wa a woman of a certain kind of determin whenev < br > duti wa concern . and becaus she had misjudg the chief engin , < br > it wa her duti to make amend . after breakfast she ask van steen if < br > she might safe go to the lower deck and look into the engine-room . < br > < br > “ you are come on remark well , ” said he . “ aren ’ t you afraid of the < br > brute ? ” < br > < br > “ i wish to thank our preserv and to inspect the ship , ” she calmli < br > answer . < br > < br > “ veri well . will you come along , nora ? ” < br > < br > “ thank , gerald , but captain o ’ shea want to show me the chart of thi < br > coast and of the bay where he will tri to land the cargo. ” < br > < br > “ hang captain o ’ shea ; he is make a confound nuisanc of himself , ” < br > mutter van steen as he reluctantli depart with miss hollist . they < br > pass among the loung patriot and came upon their leader , colonel < br > calvo , whom the flight from the cruiser had frighten , not out of hi < br > boot , but into them . as a cure for sea-sick he had found the boom < br > of an eight-inch gun extrem efficaci . he flourish hi hat with < br > flamboy gallantri and bow low as he address miss hollist . < br > < br > “ ah , ha , señora ! to behol ’ you is a pleasur for me an ’ my brave ’ of < br > soldier . yesterday we wa readi to fight the ship of spain , to defen ’ < br > the ladi with our lives. ” < br > < br > the dignifi spinster look confus . she resent the bold stare of < br > the colonel ’ s black eye and the smirk smile . with a stiff littl < br > nod she grasp gerald ’ s arm and told him , as they move to anoth < br > part of the deck : < br > < br > “ i hate that man . is he realli a brave offic ? ” < br > < br > “ not yet , but perhap , miss hollist . we shall have to ask johnni kent < br > about him. ” < br > < br > paus at the engine-room door , they found an assist on duti . to < br > their inquiri he repli : < br > < br > “ the chief is in hi bunk , all bandag up and use languag . hi arm < br > and chest were blister bad. ” < br > < br > “ i should like veri much to do someth for him , ” timidli answer < br > miss hollist . “ who is attend him ? ” < br > < br > “ the cuban doctor ha a medicin chest , ma ’ am , and we all tri to sooth < br > him . but he cuss us out and throw thing at us. ” < br > < br > “ i will look in hi room and leav a messag for you , miss hollist , ” < br > said gerald . < br > < br > “ he must be in great distress . and i am sure he is not get proper < br > care , ” she murmur . < br > < br > van steen cautious advanc to an open door beyond the engine-room , < br > miss hollist hover in the background . no sooner had the suffer < br > in the bunk caught sight of the young man than hi big voic roar : < br > < br > “ come to gloat , have you ? i suppos you ’ re glad to see me on my beam < br > end after the aw way i abus you . get to hell out of here. ” < br > < br > “ miss hollist came below to express her sympathi , ” began van steen , < br > readi to dodg a water-bottl that stood besid the bunk . < br > < br > “ holi mackerel ! the love ladi with the gray hair ? ” blurt johnni < br > kent , hi face redder than ordinari . “ did she , honestli ? is she out < br > there ? did she hear me slip that cuss-word ? ” < br > < br > “ i am afraid so . do you want to apolog ? she accept my statement < br > that you are a grand man in an emergency. ” < br > < br > “ fetch her in . no , wait a minut . straighten out the bedcloth and < br > see that my nighti is button clear up to the neck . thi is the < br > da-darnedest thing that ever happen to me. ” < br > < br > it wa also an unpreced experi for miss katharin hollist , < br > but one could not live twenty-four hour on board the _fearless_ < br > without lose one ’ s grip on convent , even though they were made < br > in new england . she halt at the brass-bound threshold of the littl < br > room , and peer curious at the recumb figur of the chief < br > engin with hi gray mustach and mop of grizzl hair . < br > < br > “ come in and take the chair by my desk , ma ’ am . what on earth made you < br > want to see me ? ” wa hi hearti greet . < br > < br > she remain stand , and confess , hesit nervous : < br > < br > “ i form such a shock opinion of you when i first saw you -- i < br > thought you had kill that negro -- and when mr. van steen told me how < br > you had toil and suffer to save the ship -- and were in pain -- i knew < br > my judgment wa mistaken -- and that it wa my duti -- -- ” < br > < br > “ forget it , ma ’ am , ” and johnni kent wave a bandag fist . “ we ain ’ t < br > pretti to look at , and our manner are violent , but when you talk about < br > duti , i guess you and i believ in the same gospel. ” < br > < br > hi gaze wa so honestli , respect worship that miss hollist < br > wa consciou of an agreeabl sensat . she wa a woman , and a < br > charm one , but at fifti year she no longer dream of masculin < br > homag . < br > < br > “ were you sever injur , mr. kent ? ” < br > < br > “ not half as much as those poor old boiler . i ’ m afraid to guess how < br > mani tube are leaki . i ’ ll quit sputterin ’ and losin ’ my temper when we < br > get those cuban and gun ashore. ” < br > < br > “ their leader doe not seem veri capabl , ” ventur miss hollist . “ i < br > wa not at all favor impress with him when he spoke to me just < br > now. ” < br > < br > “ did that sea-sick tin soldier annoy you , ma ’ am ? ” heatedli ejacul < br > johnni kent as he rais himself on hi elbow and fix a glitter < br > eye on a holster which hung on the wall . “ i ’ ll surg out of here and < br > learn him a lesson that will do him a whole lot of good. ” < br > < br > “ no more violenc , i beg of you , ” implor the spinster , dismay and < br > yet enjoy thrill . “ i should not have mention it . if there is < br > anyth that can be done to make you more comfort -- -- ” < br > < br > “ pshaw , i ’ ll be up and do befor we tri to make a land , ma ’ am . < br > your droppin ’ in to see me ha made me chirk up . bless if it don ’ t < br > make thi hole of a room seem kind of sweeten and lit up and < br > sanctified. ” < br > < br > miss hollist color and conclud that she had stay quit long < br > enough . with a graciou word of farewel , she hasten to the upper < br > deck . nora forb had found a new companion , a lean , sandi man in fade < br > khaki whose sad , freckl face had a notic pallor and whose head < br > wa wound about with a white bandag . he sat with hi back prop < br > against a boat in the shade of the awn , and nora announc to her < br > aunt : < br > < br > “ i want you to know mr. jack gorham . he is the man who conquer that < br > giant of a negro . captain o ’ shea say it wa one of the finest thing < br > he ever saw. ” < br > < br > gorham , a modest , shrink soul , look acut uncomfort and < br > protest : < br > < br > “ i had to get him . he fetch me a coupl of clip , but i feel pretti < br > spri . i ’ ll be readi to hop ashor and perfor them spanish offic < br > at a thousand per. ” < br > < br > oddli enough , miss hollist wa no longer terrifi by the presenc < br > of these men of war . sinc meet johnni kent she had suffer a < br > sea-chang . in the face of the veteran soldier she wa abl to read < br > that same qualiti of respect admir . she had been vouchsaf < br > a glimps of the real spirit of thi singular voyag . it wa pure < br > romanc , reincarn from the age when the world wa young . she had < br > been permit to sail with men who were live an odyssey , a saga , but < br > they knew it not . she thought of johnni kent in hi bunk , and now she < br > look at jack gorham , commonplac , unlett , uncouth , and listen < br > while nora repeat the stori of the fight with jiminez . the soldier < br > wriggl uneasili . hi embarrass wa pain . when question he < br > could onli repeat : < br > < br > “ well , i just had to get him . that ’ s all there wa to it. ” < br > < br > “ but you did not have to risk your life , ” persist nora . “ captain < br > o ’ shea wa readi with hi whole crew to overpow the man. ” < br > < br > “ the captain want to tackl him , but of cours i couldn ’ t stand for < br > that , ” patient explain gorham . < br > < br > “ _why_ did you do it ? ” ask miss hollist . < br > < br > “ i guess it wa what you might call a question of duti , ” he drawl . < br > < br > “ i have heard noth els , ” wa the spinster ’ s wonder comment . “ and < br > yet you are all break the law of your countri . my standard of < br > right and wrong seem all topsy-turvy. ” < br > < br > “ you sure did land in queer compani thi time , ” serious affirm < br > gorham . < br > < br > miss hollist ’ s excurs into the debat ground of conduct and < br > ethic as appli to buccan in the caribbean wa interrupt by < br > captain o ’ shea , who wa in a mood of brisk action and curt speech . < br > pay no attent to the ladi , he halt in front of gorham to say : < br > < br > “ we shall tri to put the stuff ashor to-night . will ye be fit to land < br > with the cuban , or will i carri you back home with me ? ” < br > < br > “ of cours , i ’ ll land , sir . the nigger didn ’ t cut me deep , ” wa the < br > dog respons . “ what ’ s the programm ? ” < br > < br > “ the cargo will be hoist out of the hold thi afternoon , conveni < br > for droppin ’ into the boat . if you are abl , will ye stand by to boss < br > a gang of cuban ? ye need not bear a hand yourself . just talk to them < br > and make sign with the butt end of that old springfield. ” < br > < br > “ ye , sir . i ’ ll manag to keep them busy. ” < br > < br > the news ran through the ship . by noon the patriot were seeth with < br > excit . they were about to set foot on the belov soil of cuba , < br > to be quit of the hate , perfidi ocean . they becam incred < br > valiant . these forti men would face a spanish armi . they talk of < br > march to attack fortifi citi . magic reviv , they scour < br > the rust from their weapon and brandish them with melodramat < br > gesticul . they sang the battle-hymn of the revolut and wept < br > at sight of the blue , misti mountain rang of the distant coast . jack < br > gorham regard them critic . < br > < br > one gang of cuban went into the hold and anoth wa station on < br > deck . the heavi case of rifl and cartridg were pass up through < br > the hatchway and pile along the rail . captain o ’ shea saunter hither < br > and yon , onc halt to remark in chide accent : < br > < br > “ better not bang those squar box about so free and careless . ’ ti < br > nitro-glycerin for make dynamit ashore. ” < br > < br > “ i ’ ll land it myself , ” said gorham . “ it will come in handi for blowin ’ < br > up spanish troop-trains. ” < br > < br > toward nightfal the _fearless_ reduc speed and loaf along over a < br > smooth sea at a distanc of perhap thirti mile from the coast . the < br > crisi of the voyag had come . o ’ shea must run hi ship into a trap and < br > get her out again . < br > < br > as soon as dark wa at hand the _fearless_ began the final dash < br > for the coast . johnni kent had crawl from hi bunk and wearili set < br > himself down in the engine-room doorway to await order . < br > < br > “ if anyth goe wrong to-night , it ’ ll happen all of a sudden , ” he < br > grumbl to hi first assist . “ takin ’ chanc of get bottl up < br > in a bay don ’ t pleas me a mite. ” < br > < br > “ there is noth in sight , chief . it look like an easi land . the < br > skipper know hi business. ” < br > < br > “ but it would be just our fool luck to run into troubl with these two < br > ladi aboard . women complic everi game they draw card in . but that < br > miss hollist is certainli a queen , ain ’ t she , jim ? ” < br > < br > “ she ’ s old enough to be my mother , ” ungallantli observ the youth < br > assist . < br > < br > “ and i ’ m ’ most old enough to be your grand-daddi , you godless , < br > disrespect sculpin , ” wa the angri retort of johnni kent . “ and i ’ m < br > man enough to break you in two across my knees. ” < br > < br > the rash young man wise held hi tongu , and the chief engin < br > murmur to the world at larg : < br > < br > “ refin and cultur do make a heap of differ in folk . now , if < br > i had chase after refin and cultur when i wa young , instead of < br > incessantli pursuin ’ rum , riot , and rebellion on the high sea -- but < br > what ’ s the use ? ” < br > < br > thereupon thi pensiv pirat turn to survey hi chant engin < br > and wonder what the night might bring forth . the _fearless_ < br > maintain an even gait until the coast wa no more than five mile < br > distant . then she drift idli while captain o ’ shea swept the horizon < br > with hi night-glass . hi eye and ear were acut alert , but there < br > wa neither sight nor sound of spanish blockad craft cruis to < br > intercept him . astern were pile six larg flat-bottom surf-boat , in < br > nest , as fishermen ’ s dori are carri . these were now launch and < br > tow , readi to be rang alongsid and fill with cargo . < br > < br > the forti cuban convers in hush tone . everi man had knapsack , < br > blanket-rol , canteen , and load rifl . the _fearless_ again pick up < br > full speed and move straight for the coast . soon the mountain loom < br > like gigant shadow blot out the star . it wa a bold , sheer < br > coast , indent here and there by small bay into which the river < br > flow from the pass and valley . it wa in a certain one of these < br > bay that captain o ’ shea had been told by the junta to beach hi cargo . < br > a forc of cuban led by gener maximo gomez himself would be wait < br > to receiv the munit . as had been arrang , the _fearless_ now < br > show a white mast-head light abov a red . captain o ’ shea look at < br > hi watch . three minut later hi signal-light flash again . in the < br > gloom of the mountain-sid , a white light wink abov a red . < br > < br > “ that look good to me , ” said o ’ shea to the mate . “ if there wa < br > anyth wrong , the answer signal would warn us to keep clear . but i < br > do not like thi messin ’ around in a bay . give me the open coast and < br > plenti of sea-room. ” < br > < br > the _fearless_ had come so near the entranc of the bay that the < br > shadowi headland on either side were dimli discern from the < br > bridg . the speed of the tug diminish until she wa cautious move < br > ahead with no more than steerage-way . < br > < br > the silenc wa intens . no one spoke abov a whisper . the engin were < br > turn over so slowli that their rhythmic clamor wa no more than a < br > faint , muffl throb , like the pulse-beat of the ship . warili she slid < br > into the quiet bay and made readi to drop anchor off a strip of white < br > beach . the surf-boat were haul alongsid and the cargo began to < br > tumbl into them . it look as though thi game of filibust might < br > not be so hazard as reput . the seamen were in the boat , detail < br > to handl the oar and put the cuban and the cargo ashor . < br > < br > the deep-laden flotilla had not quit the _fearless_ for the first trip < br > to the beach when the vigil skipper fanci he saw a shadow steal < br > from behind a headland at the mouth of the bay . for a long moment he < br > ceas to breath , while hi gaze follow the illus shadow which he < br > wa not sure that he could distinguish from the darken sea . < br > < br > then one or two spark gleam like fire-fli and were gone . thi wa < br > enough . captain o ’ shea instantli conclud that the spark had drop < br > from a steamer ’ s funnel . he wa caught insid the bay . perhap the < br > steamer would pass without sight the _fearless_ . but the shadow < br > halt midway between the headland , and o ’ shea curs the treacheri < br > which he presum had betray hi destin . the snare had been < br > cleverli set for him . the cuban forc in the mountain had fail to < br > detect thi spanish vessel or they would not have signal him that < br > the coast wa clear . < br > < br > o ’ shea had to make hi choic . he could abandon hi ship and flee < br > with hi crew and passeng to the beach and the jungl , or he could < br > turn and tri to smash hi way out to sea . the thought of desert < br > the _fearless_ wa so intoler that he made hi decis without < br > hesit . summon the mate and johnni kent , he spoke hurriedli . < br > < br > “ ’ ti bottl up we are . look yonder and ye can see for yourself . call < br > the men aboard and cut the boat adrift . give it to her , johnni , and < br > hold on tight . there may be the divil and all of a bump. ” < br > < br > “ goin ’ to run her down ? ” ask the chief engin . < br > < br > “ if she doesn ’ t get out of my way . ’ ti a small gun-boat most likely. ” < br > < br > < br > iii < br > < br > the patriot were unabl to adjust themselv to the sudden shift of < br > event . one moment they were about to land , rejoic and valor , to < br > be welcom by the tatter legion of maximo gomez , and the next they < br > were snatch away to surg hell-bent in the direct of the enemi and < br > the detest sea . captain o ’ shea might have delay to dump them < br > into the boat and turn them adrift to flounder about the bay , but < br > in all probabl the spanish gun-boat would overtak and slay mani < br > befor they could reach the shore . he did not love them , but it wa hi < br > duti to safeguard them along with the cargo . < br > < br > less than ten minut after the shadow had move across the entranc of < br > the bay , the _fearless_ wa swing to point her nose seaward . as soon < br > as the tug wa fairli straighten out , o ’ shea rang for full speed . it < br > wa no longer a silent ship . the patriot rais a lament outcri of < br > grief and indign , unabl to comprehend thi slip between the cup < br > and the lip . they were unconvinc that the captain had realli seen a < br > gun-boat . they accus him of take fright at phantom . < br > < br > inde , there wa no such thing as slip unperceiv past the < br > wait enemi , for besid the loud protest of the cuban , the engin < br > of the _fearless_ made a strident song that re-echo from the wood < br > shore . no longer in ambush , the spanish craft turn on a search-light < br > whose stream radianc pick the tug out of the gloom like a < br > lantern-slid project on a screen . the two vessel were perhap four < br > hundr yard apart . straight into the path of the search-light rush < br > the _fearless_ , veer neither to right nor left . her tactic were < br > disconcert , her insan temer wholli unexpect . it wa obviou < br > that unless the gun-boat veri hastili move out of the way there would < br > occur an impress collis . and the tall steel-shod prow of an < br > ocean-go tug is apt to shatter the thin plate of a light-draught , < br > coastwis gun-boat . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea himself held the wheel . the spanish gunner hurriedli < br > open fire , but sensat of panic-smitten amaz spoil their < br > aim , and they might as well have been shoot at the moon . < br > < br > “ by juda ! ye are so gay with your search-light , i will just have a < br > look at you , ” mutter o ’ shea as he switch on the power light < br > which wa mount upon the wheel-hous roof . the handsom gun-boat < br > wa sharpli reveal , her sailor group at the quick-fir piec < br > on the superstructur , the offic cluster forward . jack gorham ’ s < br > springfield boom like a small cannon , and a man with gold stripe on < br > hi sleev toppl from hi station and sprawl on the deck below . < br > < br > the cuban cheer and let fli a scatter , futil rifl fire , but < br > the crew of the _fearless_ , convinc that they must fight for their < br > skin , crouch behind the heavi bulwark and handl their mauser < br > with method earnest . the spanish offic and seamen took to < br > cover . they were not use to be shot at , and thi filibust tug < br > wa behav like a full-fledg pirat . the command of the gun-boat < br > made up hi mind to dodg collis and sink the _fearless_ with hi < br > gun befor she should flee beyond rang outsid the bay . hi mental < br > machineri wa not work swiftli , becaus thi wa what might be < br > call hi crowd hour . he tri to swing hi vessel head on and to < br > sheer to one side of the channel . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea climb the spoke of hi steering-wheel and swung the < br > _fearless_ to meet the manœuvr . he wa bent on crippl the gun-boat . < br > with leaki boiler tube , the tug wa in no condit for anoth stern < br > chase and the spanish gunner would certainli hull her through and < br > through and explod the cargo befor he could run clear of the hostil < br > search-light . < br > < br > a few second later , the foam bow of the _fearless_ struck the < br > gun-boat a quarter , glanc blow that rake along her side . the < br > spanish command had almost twist hi vessel out of the other ’ s < br > path and o ’ shea dare not swing to catch her broadsid on , for fear < br > of run aground . the impact wa terrif . the spanish craft had a < br > low freeboard and the gun of her main-deck batteri protrud their < br > long muzzl onli a few feet abov the water . the steel stem of the < br > _fearless_ , move with tremend momentum , struck them one after the < br > other , tore them from their mount and strip the starboard side < br > clean . the tug ’ s headway wa check and a tangl of splinter stuff < br > held the two vessel interlock . the spanish gunner on the upper deck < br > could not suffici depress the secondari batteri to fire down into < br > the _fearless_ , and on board the tug all hand had been knock flat by < br > the collis , so that for the moment there wa no hostil action on < br > either side . < br > < br > so close togeth were the two steamer while they hung togeth that < br > case of cargo , toppl over , spill through the crush bulwark of < br > the _fearless_ , and slid upon the gun-boat ’ s lower deck where the side < br > had been fairli rip out of her abov the water-lin . then the tug < br > veri slowli forg ahead , tear herself free and grind against the < br > gun-boat ’ s crack and twist plate until the twain part compani . < br > < br > “ we are still afloat , glori be , and the engin are turnin ’ over , ” < br > cri o ’ shea . < br > < br > he spun the wheel hard over to pass out to sea between the headland , < br > and steer where he thought deep water ought to be . the gun-boat had < br > not open fire , and he began to hope that he might win the freedom of < br > the sea . nor wa the hostil vessel make ani effort to follow him , < br > and instead of blaze hi trail with her search-light it had been < br > turn skyward to flash signal for assist against the cloud . < br > < br > “ i jolt the ambit out of her , ” joy exclaim o ’ shea . “ i would < br > not like to look at my poor old hooker , but she must be an aw hash < br > on deck -- -- ” < br > < br > the _fearless_ suddenli yaw to starboard and took the bit in her < br > teeth . the skipper tri to fetch her back on her cours , but she < br > fail to respond to the wheel . he instantli knew that a rudder chain < br > had part . he yell down the tube to johnni kent to revers hi < br > engin . the masterless tug wa head out of the channel and the < br > incom tide caught her bow and swung her away from the seaward < br > passag , over toward the nearest headland and it submerg reef . < br > < br > the _fearless_ felt the power backward drag of her screw , but not < br > in time . the disabl steering-gear wrought the mischief befor the < br > emerg tiller could be man or an anchor drop to hold her in < br > the channel . her keel scrape along the coral bottom and the hull < br > trembl to the shock of strand . the _fearless_ wa hard and fast < br > aground and the tide lack three hour of the flood . < br > < br > find it useless to tri to work her off , captain o ’ shea had the < br > engin stop . the plight wa soon discov by the gun-boat , which < br > brought her search-light to bear on the tug . the spanish command < br > laugh , no doubt , when he perceiv that he could train hi remain < br > gun and smash the _fearless_ to piec at hi leisur . it wa < br > point-blank rang at a conspicu target , and the tabl had been < br > turn . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea comprehend the fate that wa about to overtak hi < br > helpless ship . hi boat had been cut adrift and there wa no mean of < br > convey hi peopl to the shore . they could onli swim for it and tri < br > to find foot on the reef . < br > < br > “ ’ ti no use show a white flag and offer to surrend , ” he said < br > to himself while the sweat ran down hi face . “ we fire on them and we < br > ram their ship. ” < br > < br > there wa a life-raft on the deck-hous roof , and he wa about to order < br > it shove oversid in order to send nora forb and miss hollist < br > ashor in charg of van steen and the mate . it wa a forlorn hope , < br > becaus the gun-boat would most like fire at anyth seen afloat . < br > just then jack gorham climb to the bridg and respect salut < br > the captain . < br > < br > “ we are up against it , jack , ” said o ’ shea . “ the spaniard yonder is < br > take hi time . he will anchor bow and stern and then shoot us to < br > splinter . i will be grate if ye will lend the mate and young van < br

onc hi < br > voic wa unsteadi with excit . “ when we were tangl alongsid the < br > gun-boat , some case of cargo wa jolt off our deck onto her deck < br > where the woodwork and plate wa all tore away . for god ’ s sake , put < br > your search-light on her for a minut , quick , befor she swing her < br > smash side away from us . she ’ s still turnin ’ . ” < br > < br > “ and for what ? ” queri o ’ shea , but he leap for the lighting-switch , < br > confid that the soldier knew what he wa talk about . < br > < br > “ two of them case wa nitro-glycerin , sir , and for a wonder they slid < br > so easi that they didn ’ t go off . i know them when i see ’ em . just give < br > me one sight of them. ” < br > < br > the search-light of the _fearless_ swept across the gun-boat , which < br > wa slowli shift her posit to find the middl of the channel < br > and a safe anchorag . there wa cramp room to manœuvr , and she < br > wa swing in a small arc which expos for a littl time the < br > shatter side that had been ram by the tug . a gape hole abov < br > water disclos the main-deck forward , and the search-light of the < br > _fearless_ play and flicker in and out , white and brilliant . it < br > illumin the wreckag and the heap of wooden case which lay as they < br > had slid across the fragment of bulwark that bridg the narrow gap < br > between the interlock vessel . < br > < br > “ hold the light steadi , sir , ” said jack gorham as he drop to < br > one knee , shove the barrel of the springfield across the rail of < br > the bridg , and laid hi cheek against the stock . “ it seem plumb < br > ridicul , but it ’ s worth tryin ’ . ” < br > < br > hi wonder keen eye had distinguish a squar wooden case which < br > sat expos and somewhat remov from the other on the gun-boat ’ s < br > litter deck . he had brag of hi marksmanship . now wa the suprem < br > opportun to make good . the gun-boat wa move . her shatter side < br > would be hidden from him befor he could shoot more than twice or < br > thrice . < br > < br > as the sight of hi belov old rifl came true on the tini target he < br > press the trigger and the heavi bullet went sing on it way . < br > < br > “ miss , by godfrey ! ” grunt gorham as he reload . “ if i score a < br > bull ’ s-ey , you ’ ll know it all right. ” < br > < br > annoy by thi impertin , the gun-boat let drive with a one-pound < br > which put a shell through the funnel of the _fearless_ and shower < br > the deck with soot . gorham wipe hi eye and took aim for the second < br > shot . good luck and good marksmanship guid it . no need to wonder < br > where thi bullet struck . the case of nitro-glycerin explod with a < br > prodigi deton that seem to shake earth and sea and sky . the < br > forward part of the gun-boat wa envelop in a great sheet of flame . < br > the peopl of the _fearless_ were stun and deafen and the hull < br > rock violent against the reef . burn fragment rain everywher , < br > and fell hiss into the bay . from the place where the gun-boat wa < br > rapidli sink came cri for help . < br > < br > “ she is gone entir . god help their poor soul , ” brokenli murmur < br > captain o ’ shea . < br > < br > he turn to shout to the mate : < br > < br > “ pull yourself togeth and paddl over yonder with the life-raft . pick < br > up all ye find of the poor men in the water and set them ashor . the < br > cuban armi will take care of them as prison of war . and mayb you < br > can find some of our boat . ’ ti an aw sight to see a fine vessel < br > snuf out like a candle. ” < br > < br > jack gorham sat on deck , hi head in hi hand , a disconsol figur . < br > < br > “ i made a wonder shot , ” he mutter , “ but i hope i ’ ll never have to < br > make anoth one like it. ” < br > < br > “ bridg , ahoy ! ” roar johnni kent from the lower deck . “ thi is < br > war . we beat ’ em to it . now let ’ s get thi tug off the reef on the < br > flood tide , if we rip the bottom out of her . thi bay will be full of < br > gun-boat and cruiser to-morrow. ” < br > < br > go below for the first time sinc the _fearless_ had enter the < br > bay , the skipper found the deck in chaotic confus . broken bulwark , < br > smash door and window , part funnel-stay , twist deck-hous , < br > and other sign of the collis were strewn from bow to stern . some < br > twenti of the patriot had dive overboard . of those left on board , < br > sever had been hurt , and the crew of the _fearless_ were badli cut , < br > bruis , and bang about . < br > < br > o ’ shea ralli all that were abl to turn to , and set them to throw < br > cargo overboard . the gun and ammunit were pack in water-proof < br > case and could be fish up by the cuban armi at low tide . it wa < br > heavi materi , and get rid of two or three hundr ton of it < br > must consider lighten the strand tug . at thi back-break task < br > doggedli labor gerald van steen without wait for an order . captain < br > o ’ shea stare at him by the light of a lantern as though remind of < br > someth import . < br > < br > “ the ladi ! ” cri he . “ are they safe and sound ? ” < br > < br > “ they are aliv , thank you , ” said van steen . “ i stow them in their < br > room , and made them lie on the floor with the mattress tuck against < br > the wall to stop the bullet . i could think of noth els to do. ” < br > < br > “ and how did they take it ? ” < br > < br > “ veri well , inde . miss hollist ha been rather hyster , but one < br > can scarc blame her. ” < br > < br > “ well , the worst may be over , and again it may not , ” thought < br > explain o ’ shea . “ now , ’ ti thi way . i can set you peopl ashor , < br > and ye can take a chanc that the cuban armi will be abl to send you < br > insid the spanish line under a flag of truce . but there may be week < br > of hard live and fever and exposur befor ye get anywher at all . < br > and it may be the death of the ladi . or you can stay with me , if we < br > get thi vessel off , and i will carri you back to the unit states. ” < br > < br > “ it isn ’ t a hilari proposit either way , ” repli van steen . “ i < br > rather think , though , that we had better stick to you. ” < br > < br > the mate return aboard with the tide that more than half the crew < br > of the gun-boat had been rescu by the life-raft and in boat which < br > had drift to the beach . < br > < br > “ we ought to have those boat in case we need them , ” said the skipper ; < br > “ but if the ship can be work off thi tide , and is fit to go to sea , < br > i will not wait for them or anyth else. ” < br > < br > the tide wa rise fast and the compani work like mad to heav the < br > cargo overboard . at length johnni kent set hi engin go hard < br > astern and the _fearless_ began to slide along her coral bed . halt , < br > bump , grind , she gradual move into the deeper water of the < br > channel and roll in the swell that ran past the headland . collis < br > and strand had fear rack and strain her hull , and the < br > captain wa not surpris when johnni kent bellow from below : < br > < br > “ we ’ re leakin ’ , of cours . i guess everi rivet in her must have pull < br > loos . you ’ d better pray for a spell of good weather. ” < br > < br > “ would ye rather be shot or drown decent in a gale of wind , johnni ? < br > ’ ti suicid to stay on thi coast till daylight. ” < br > < br > the forlorn tug limp out to sea at her best speed , which wa not < br > much . the fire-room gang wa more or less disabl and the engin < br > need a deal of tinker . drop an able-bodi man from a third-stori < br > window and he may not break hi neck , but hi gait is not apt to be < br > brisk . < br > < br > “ by the holi poker ! ” ejacul o ’ shea to the mate as they watch the < br > shadowi mountain drop astern . “ we deliv the cargo , though it is in < br > a few feet of water , but i have some patriot left . i could think of < br > onli one thing at a time . what will i do with them ? ” < br > < br > “ you can search me , sir . dump ’ em ashor at key west , if we ever get < br > that far. ” < br > < br > “ i will not run into thi coast again with a leaki old crab of a ship < br > and no more than coal enough to carri me to a friendli port. ” < br > < br > men must sleep , and when the _fearless_ had left the coast twenti mile < br > behind her captain o ’ shea set the regular watch and curl up on < br > the wheel-hous transom for a nap befor daylight . johnni kent , after < br > a sorrow survey of hi engin and boiler , crawl into hi bunk < br > and present hi snore rose and fell with the cadenc beat of the < br > steam-pump that fought to keep the water from rise in the leaki hold . < br > the sea wa smooth , the cloud no longer obscur the star , and the < br > weari crew wa suffer to rest befor clear away the wreckag and < br > patch the broken upper work . < br > < br > when o ’ shea awok the dawn wa bright and a fresh breez whip across < br > an empti sea . georg , the cook , greet him with melancholi demeanor . < br > < br > “ you-al suttinli did play th ’ mischief with mah galley when you < br > kerbump that gun-boat , cap ’ n . everi la ’ dish is busted. ” < br > < br > “ where were you , georg ? ” < br > < br > “ hidin ’ behind th ’ rang , pleas , suh . an ’ when that there spaniard < br > blew up it broke all th ’ galley window an ’ fill me plumb full of < br > glass . ain ’ t we had mo ’ excit enough ? ” < br > < br > “ i hope so . did your friend , big jiminez , swim ashor last night ? ” < br > < br > “ no , suh . he ’ s in th ’ galley helpin ’ me straighten thing out . him an ’ < br > me ain ’ t a mite hostil . mistah gorham suttinli did knock a heap o ’ < br > sens into that niggah ’ s skull. ” < br > < br > the breez blew with steadili increas weight and began to kick up < br > a choppi sea which rack the sluggish , labor tug . johnni kent < br > report that the pump wa not keep the water down as easili as < br > dure the night . o ’ shea chew over thi disquiet news and wa < br > undecid whether to attempt the long passag around cape san antonio < br > into the gulf of mexico . the altern wa to run for jamaica and < br > take refug in the nearest neutral port . the english govern would < br > probabl seiz hi ship , but her compani would be safe against arrest < br > and condemn as pirat by the spanish author . < br > < br > while he wa consid thi grave problem hi eye were gladden < br > by the sight of nora forb , who came on deck and halt to gaze < br > with amaz at the wreck appear of the vessel . her splendid < br > color pale and she smile rather tremul at captain o ’ shea , who < br > reassur her : < br > < br > “ we are still afloat , but we look like a junk heap . and how did ye < br > pull through ? and is your aunt get the upper hand of that nervou < br > prostrat ? ” < br > < br > “ miss hollist wa terribl frighten , and -- and -- so wa i. i would < br > rather not hear about all that happen last night -- not just yet. ” < br > < br > “ and i would rather not think of it , just now , miss forb . perhap i < br > ought to have set ye ashor among the cuban . i hope you will not be < br > wors off at sea again. ” < br > < br > “ i am glad to be at sea again , with you , captain o ’ shea , ” said nora , < br > and she look him in the eye like a true vike ’ s daughter who < br > scorn subterfug and spoke as her heart move her . < br > < br > it wa perhap as well that gerald van steen decid to join them just < br > then . < br > < br > “ and are ye convinc that the spanish are not a courteou peopl when < br > ye meet them by night ? ” o ’ shea cheer ask him . < br > < br > “ do you know , i begin to like thi filibust , ” answer the < br > industri young man , who look as trampish as ani of the crew . “ one < br > feel so well pleas after he ha pull out of one of these scrape < br > that it is almost worth while run into it. ” he turn to nora and < br > address her with a shade of appeal in hi voic : “ will you sit down < br > with me for a while ? i have no end of thing to talk about. ” < br > < br > “ whi , certainli , gerald . good-bi , captain o ’ shea . the top o ’ the < br > morn to ye. ” < br > < br > the captain bow and rais hi straw hat . hi ingenu counten < br > wore a somewhat puzzl express , as if he beheld a new complic < br > in thi tumultu voyag of hi . < br > < br > it wa well into the forenoon befor johnni kent found a < br > breathing-spel and climb abov to confer with the skipper . the < br > indomit engin appear age and haggard . the pain of hi burn < br > distress him and he wa spent with worri and weari . hi hand < br > trembl as he pull himself up the bridg stairway . < br > < br > “ i ain ’ t as young as i wa , cap ’ n mike , ” he huskili exclaim . “ blame < br > if i don ’ t feel kind of strain and shook up , same as the poor old < br > _fearless_ . look like one of them fair-weath gale , don ’ t it ? bright < br > sky and a big sea and wind to peel your whisker off befor night. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti a good guess , ” soberli repli o ’ shea . “ can we weather it , < br > johnni ? ” < br > < br > “ i don ’ t want to make the ladi nervou and fretti , ” confid the < br > chief , “ but we ain ’ t keepin ’ the water down , cap ’ n mike . it will be in < br > the

and keep < br > her go ? ” < br > < br > “ they will , cap ’ n mike . the big nigger feel spri enough to turn to , < br > and the gang is scare to death of him . they believ he ’ ll murder ’ em < br > if they quit on me. ” < br > < br > “ well , johnni , make steam as long as ye can , and if the weather will < br > not moder i can tri to fetch up somewher befor she goe to the < br > bottom. ” < br

, ” and johnni kent beam . “ ladi like her are mighti < br > refin and delic and sensit , and they ’ re liabl to be took with < br > thi nervou prostrat . i don ’ t blame her a bit , cap ’ n mike . whi , < br > when we pile up on that reef and the gun-boat wa fixin ’ to shoot us < br > all to hell-and-gon , i felt nervou myself . honest i did. ” < br > < br > “ go to it , johnni , but don ’ t mention the fact that we are due to < br > founder as the next act of thi continu performance. ” < br > < br > it wa realli extraordinari to see how much anim came into the < br > face of miss hollist when johnni kent poke hi gray head insid < br > the open door and grin a bash greet . never did a hero wear < br > a more unromant aspect , but the spinster had select him as her < br > own particular

devot to duti , and simpl kindli of thi grizzl old sea rover . < br > < br > “ i ’ m asham that we had to give you such a scare last night , ma ’ am , ” < br > he began . “ it ’ s a hoodoo voyag , ani way you look at it . whi , cap ’ n < br > mike and me ran a cargo into hayti last summer and you would have < br > enjoy it . stuff on the beach in three hour and a funni old stone < br > fort bangin

sluggishli over a roll , foami , blue sea . < br > alreadi the water in the hold had diminish her natur buoyanc . < br > the wave leap through her broken bulwark and flung themselv < br > across the deck . the crew and the remain cuban had a listless , < br > discourag demeanor . their energi wa deaden by misfortun . the < br > voyag wa ill-fat . jack gorham , by contrast , undertook whatev < br

green . it wa the < br > key , and as the _fearless_ move nearer it wa seen that the veget < br > compris onli a few rag bush . desol , sun-bak , and wind-swept < br > wa the place , but it wa dri land , and better than the deep sea in a < br > founder ship . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea laid down hi glass and call van steen . < br > < br > “ ’ ti not what i expect , but the _fearless_ is done for , ” said he . < br > “ we have fresh water and store to last some time . and i have faith < br > enough in me luck to feel sure we will be pick off that bit of a key < br > yonder . pleas ask the ladi to pack their trap , and you will put < br > life-belt around them. ” < br > < br > as the _fearless_ lurch drunkenli toward the beach , it seem as < br > though everi comber would stamp her under . the water in the hold had < br > cover the fire-room floor , and wa hiss and swash under the < br > furnac . the deck-hand were strung along the ladder and hatch , < br > bail with bucket to aid the choke , sputter steam-pump . < br > < br > “ i ain ’ t got ani busi to be drown in thi lump of a tug , ” said < br > johnni kent to the first assist . “ i ’ m thinkin ’ about that farm with < br > the hollyhock and plymouth rocks. ” < br > < br > “ if that pump stop , which it ha symptom of do , you ’ d better be < br > think of your wick old soul , ” growl the assist . < br > < br > “ i can ’ t swim a lick , ” mutter the chief engin . < br > < br > “ you ’ d better learn quick . there go the fire , ” yell the other as < br > cloud of steam pour out of the engine-room , and the men below came < br > up the ladder , fight , scrambl , swear . johnni kent dodg the < br > wild rush , glanc out to sea , and shout , “ breaker ahead ! there are < br > a few more kick in the old packet and she ’ ll hit the beach yet. ” < br > < br > as the steam pressur rapidli ran down , the die engin turn over < br > more and more feebli , but the propel continu to push the vessel < br > veri languidli into the shoal water . present she ceas to move , < br > there wa a slight jar , and she heel to starboard . the doom tug < br > rest upon a sandi bottom . < br > < br > now that she wa inert , aground , lift no more to the heav and swing < br > of the sea , the breaker shook her with an incess bombard . < br > spray flew over the bridg and pelt into the cabin window . the key < br > wa about three hundr yard distant from the tug . between her and the < br > dri land wa a strip of deeper water than the shoal on which she had < br > strand , and then the wide barrier of surf where the breaker toss < br > and tumbl in a thunder tumult . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea scan the angri water and wonder how he could send < br > hi peopl through it . the clumsi life-raft wa all he had to put them < br > on . it wa buoyant enough , but unmanag in such boister weather < br > as thi , and would most like be blown out to sea and miss the key < br > entir . to remain on board and hope for quieter weather on the morrow < br > wa to risk pound to piec overnight . < br > < br > then o ’ shea caught sight of the jag timber of an ancient wreck < br > half cover by the sand on the ridg of the key . if a line could be < br > carri from the ship and made fast to one of those stout timber , the < br > life-raft might be haul through the surf . < br > < br > “ ’ ti a terribl swim to undertak , ” he pain reflect . “ i will < br > tri it meself , but if i go under there is nobodi to take charg of < br > these peopl . my men are a rough lot , and it will be hard live on < br > thi god-forsaken bit of a key. ” < br > < br > as if jack gorham had read what wa in the skipper ’ s mind , he crawl < br > across the slope deck and shout someth in the ear of jiminez . < br > the negro nod and wave an arm in the direct of the beach . the < br > soldier wa urg and explain , the other eagerli assent . gorham < br > shout to the bridg : < br > < br > “ thi fine big nigger of mine will carri a rope ashor . he can swim < br > like a duck , and there ’ s nobodi aboard with half hi strength. ” < br > < br > “ aye , aye , jack ! ” exclaim o ’ shea . “ i will give him a heaving-lin , < br > and when he hit the beach he can haul a light hawser ashor and make < br > it fast. ” < br > < br > jiminez had no need to strip for activ servic , clad as he wa onli in < br > tatter dungare breech chop off abov the knee . it wa appar < br > that he propos risk hi life becaus the soldier had ask it of < br > him . for the live of the other he care not a snap of hi finger . < br > knot an end of the heaving-lin around hi waist , he pois himself < br > upon the guard-rail , a herculean statu of eboni . gorham grasp hi < br > hand and said in farewel : < br > < br > “ you keep on go , jiminez , old boy , or i ’ ll cave in your cocoanut < br > with the butt of my springfield. ” < br > < br > the negro grin and shot downward into the foam sea . hi round < br > head and gleam shoulder emerg for an instant and then he dive < br > again to pass under the toppl crest of a breaker . a few overhand < br > stroke , and he wa in the deeper water with a hundr yard of < br > compar easi swim . he plough through it with tremend < br > eas and power while captain o ’ shea paid out the heaving-lin in hi < br > wake . turn on hi back , jiminez rest befor the final struggl < br > with the surf on the beach . < br > < br > the peopl on the _fearless_ forgot their forlorn situat . they were < br > absorb in the pictur of the bright , hot sand , the dazzl wall of < br > surf , with the gull dip and scream overhead , and the toss < br > figur of the black swimmer . jiminez vanish in the outer line of < br > breaker , bob into view for an instant , and wa whirl over and < br > over . the undertow caught him and pull him down , but he fought clear < br > and came to the surfac , now beaten seaward , now gain a yard or so . < br > < br > from the tug it look as though he were be batter about like < br > a piec of drift wreckag , but the sea could not drown him . more < br > than onc the behold were sure he had been conquer . then they < br > shout as they saw him shoot landward on the crest back of a rear < br > comber . he felt the sand with hi feet . he wa knock down and roll < br > back , but regain a foothold and resist the drag of the out-rush < br > wave . wade power , he stumbl into shallow water and fell on < br > hi knee , too exhaust to walk , and crawl on all four to the dri < br > sand . there he sprawl on hi back like a dead man , while the heart < br > of those on board the _fearless_ beat slow and heavi with suspens . a < br > littl while and jiminez stagger to hi feet , shook himself like a < br > dog , and made for the timber of the old wreck . make the end of the < br > heaving-lin fast , he threw hi arm over hi head as a signal . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea bent to the other end of the line the strong rope which < br > he had use for tow the surf-boat . jiminez sat himself down , dug < br > hi heel in the sand , and began to haul in like a human capstan . the < br > rope trail slowli through the surf without mishap , and the negro < br > firmli belay it to one of the embed timber . have accomplish < br > what he had set out to do , jiminez sensibl roll over , pillow hi < br > head on hi arm , and let the other men rescu themselv . < br > < br > the life-raft wa now shove overboard and secur to the sway rope < br > by mean of pulley block . four pick men and the mate were detail < br > to make the first trip , which wa in the natur of an experi . they < br > paddl the life-raft across the strip of quieter water , the pulley < br > hold them close to the fasten hawser . when the raft reach the < br > surf , they laid hold of the hawser and lustili haul their career < br > craft shoreward , hand over hand . drench and breathless , they gain < br > the beach and sought a few minut ’ rest befor undertak the return < br > journey . < br > < br > as soon as the raft had safe come back to the _fearless_ captain < br > o ’ shea shout : < br > < br > “ now for the ladi ! ’ ti time they quit the poor old hooker. ” < br > < br > nora forb wa wait , a lith round arm about miss hollist ’ s < br > waist . the spinster wa white to the lip , and her eye sought , not the < br > protect care of gerald van steen , but the brace presenc of that < br > stout-heart old pirat johnni kent , who wa profan wrestl with < br > the fresh-wat barrel . < br > < br > “ you will get wet , ladi , ” said o ’ shea , “ but ’ ti not at all < br > danger . the raft will take you through the surf like a toboggan . mr. < br > van steen will go with you . ye are a brave pair , and i would ask no < br > better shipmates. ” < br > < br > the raft wa pitch and buck alongsid , but the lower deck of the < br > vessel wa now level with the sea . o ’ shea caught miss hollist in hi < br > arm , wade to the rail with her and wait until van steen and the < br > other men were readi to catch her . then with a wrench heav , o ’ shea < br > toss her into their outstretch arm . it wa nora forb ’ s turn to < br > leav the vessel . < br > < br > “ you will pardon the liberti , ” o ’ shea whisper in her ear , “ but thi < br > is no small consol for lose me ship. ” < br > < br > he swung her clear of the deck and her arm , perforc , had to cling < br > around hi neck while he balanc himself with sailorli agil and < br > wait for the tug to right itself and the raft to rise on the next < br > wave . perhap he held her a moment longer than wa necessari . captain < br > michael o ’ shea wa a man with a warm heart and red blood in him . < br > deftli and care he swung her over the rail , and the men on the < br > raft place her besid miss hollist . nora wave her hand in a blith < br > farewel . miss hollist had close her eye , but she open them < br > quickli enough when johnni kent came roll aft to flourish hi cap < br > and shout : < br > < br > “ sorri i can ’ t make the passag with you . we ’ ll have lot of time to < br > talk flower and hen on that patch of sand , but it look like mighti < br > poor soil for gardenin ’ ma ’ am. ” < br > < br > guid by the pulley-block that creak along the hawser , the raft < br > made the tempestu passag through the surf . the shipwreck ladi < br > set themselv down on a sandi hummock in the hot sunshin . they were < br > waterlog and appear quit calm and collect becaus they lack < br > strength for anyth els . < br > < br > the raft pli to and fro in a race against time . such store as < br > would be damag by wet were wrap in tarpaulin . the preciou < br > water-barrel were fill from the ship ’ s tank , and the wise johnni < br > kent pack spare copper pipe , a gasolen torch , empti tin case , < br > and tool for make a condens to distil salt water . captain o ’ shea < br > took care to send all the arm which had been serv out to the crew , < br > besid sever box of rifl and ammunit that had been overlook < br > in dump the cargo . also he save a number of shovel and pick < br > design for use as intrench tool . < br > < br > befor the last load of stuff had been haul to the beach , the < br > _fearless_ wa driven so far on the shoal that she began to break < br > amidship . o ’ shea order colonel calvo and hi cuban off the vessel , < br > and then sent hi crew ashor . he wa left on board with johnni kent , < br > jack gorham , and the men need to help manag the life-raft . the < br > littl group stood in the lee of the deck-hous . the tragedi of the < br > ship oppress them . they were mourner at the funer of a faith < br > friend . sentiment johnni kent exclaim with a huski note in hi < br > voic : < br > < br > “ the _fearless_ did her best for us , cap ’ n mike . it ’ s a rotten finish < br > for a respect , god-fearin ’ tow-boat. ” < br > < br > “ she wa a good littl vessel , johnni , ” softli quoth o ’ shea . “ but those < br > gun we dump in the bay will come in mighti use to old maximo < br > gomez , and mayb the voyag is worth while after all. ” < br > < br > “ i seem to be sort of side-track , but i ain ’ t complainin ’ , ” murmur < br > jack gorham . “ i hope the cuban will keep the rebellion move along < br > until i can get to ’ em and help mix it up. ” < br > < br > one by one they jump to the raft and captain o ’ shea wa the last man < br > to leav . with a shake of the head he turn to gaze no more at the < br > _fearless_ , but at the disconsol cluster of men on the key , who were < br > wait for him to take command . < br > < br > < br > iv < br > < br > with readi resourc and dynam energi , o ’ shea proceed to organ < br > the refuge . the dreari littl sand-bank wa no longer popul by < br > discourag loafer , but by busi , shout toiler who made a camp < br > with the cheer zest of children at play . there were tarpaulin , < br > storm-sail , and awn to fashion shelter from the sun and rain . the < br > beach wa strewn with an accumul of drift-wood which serv to cut < br > into upright and cross-piec that were lash togeth with bit of < br > line . in thi wise a tent wa built for the two women . it wa set apart < br > from the other camp with an ingeni amount of comfort and privaci . < br > < br > the crew of the _fearless_ flock togeth , while colonel calvo and < br > hi cuban establish themselv in quarter of their own . all thi < br > wa a two day ’ task , at the end of which the shipwreck compani , < br > utterli fag , slept and rest most earnestli and took no thought of < br > the morrow . the bless respit from excit and alarm lull them < br > like an anodyn . < br > < br > when , at length , the camp came out of it tranc , captain o ’ shea < br > discov that hi work wa cut out for him to devis a daili routin < br > which should maintain obedi , disciplin , and good-natur . hi own < br > men were accustom to an activ life , their energi wa exuber , and < br > when not fight the sea they enjoy fight among themselv . on < br > shipboard they obey by instinct becaus it wa the iron tradit of < br > their call , but on the key these bond were inevit loosen . < br > < br > while thi wa to be expect , the behavior of the surviv patriot < br > wa noth short of phenomen . they were rid of the curs of the sea < br > which had wilt them bodi and soul . the immov land wa under their < br > feet . they laugh and display an astonish vivac . they strut < br > importantli , soldier unafraid . even colonel calvo wa reanim . hi < br > sword clank at hi side . larg silver spur dash on the heel of < br > hi boot and he perceiv noth absurd in wear them . hi attitud < br > toward captain o ’ shea wa haughti , even distant . it wa appar that < br > thi miracul reviv warrior consid himself the rank < br > offic of the island . he signifi that he would take entir charg of < br > matter in hi own camp . < br > < br > o ’ shea wa surpris . at sea the patriot had been so much bothersom , < br > unlov freight . < br > < br > “ ’ ti comic , ” he said to himself . “ i took it for grant that i wa < br > the boss of the whole outfit. ” < br > < br > common-sens and experi told captain o ’ shea that he must keep all < br > hand busi , if he had to invent work for them . he therefor stake out < br > a rectangular space of consider extent and set them to throw < br > up sand to form four wall sever feet thick within which the compani < br > might find shelter . it wa a simpl pattern of earthwork , but more < br > effici to resist bullet and shell than stone or concret . < br > < br > “ we may not need to scuttl into it , ” he explain to jack gorham , “ but < br > if one of those spanish blockadin ’ craft should accident cruis off < br > shore , we will be in shape to stand her off . anyhow , it will keep our < br > tarrier occupi for a while. ” < br > < br > “ how do you frame it up that we ’ re goin ’ to get away from thi gob of < br > sand ? ” ask the chief engin . “ not that i ’ m fretti , cap ’ n mike , or < br > findin ’ fault , but i ’ ve seen place that i like better. ” < br > < br > “ we will mark time a littl longer , johnni , and then if a schooner or < br > steamer doesn ’ t happen by , i will rig a sail on the life-raft , and send < br > it to the south ’ ard . how are the ladi to-day ? i have had no time to < br > pay a social call. ” < br > < br > “ miss hollist don ’ t seem as droopin ’ as she wa . i dri out a pack < br > of card that wa in my jumper , and we play some whist . if you want < br > to set in , cap ’ n mike , i ’ ll drop out . i ain ’ t realli grace and easi < br > in a game where there ’ s more than five card dealt to a hand. ” < br > < br > “ thank you , but i am handicap in the same way , johnni . i will stroll < br > over and pay me respect befor supper. ” < br > < br > “ miss forb seem a mite peevish that you haven ’ t made more track < br > toward their tent , ” observ the engin . < br > < br > “ pshaw , they are glad to have the chanc to be by themselves. ” < br > < br > nevertheless , captain o ’ shea appear interest when he spi miss < br > forb saunter alon on the beach , and at some distanc from her < br > tent . < br > < br > “ miss hollist is asleep and mr. van steen is tri to mend hi shoe < br > with a piec of wire , ” said nora . “ and i have done my week ’ s wash < br > like an industri girl , and now i ’ m look for someon to play with. ” < br > < br > “ would you like to walk to the far end of the key , miss forb ? and < br > then , perhap , ye would care to inspect the camp . we have a ship-shap < br > littl settlement , if i do say it meself. ” < br > < br > “ an explor expedit ? i shall be delight , ” cri she , < br > unconsci glanc at the tent which hid the chaperon and also < br > gerald van steen . < br > < br > they stroll a littl way without speak . o ’ shea halt to gaze at < br > the wreck of the _fearless_ . with quick sympathi , the girl understood < br > and made no comment . he turn away with a sorrow smile and broke < br > the silenc . < br > < br > “ ’ ti strang how close a man ’ s ship is to hi heart . i wish i did not < br > have to see her. ” < br > < br > “ there will be other ship for a man like you , captain o ’ shea , ” said < br > nora . < br > < br > “ but never a voyag like thi one , miss forbes. ” < br > < br > “ i wa think the same thought . for me there will never be a voyag < br > like thi , captain o ’ shea. ” < br > < br > “ for misfortun and bedivil gener , do ye mean ? ” he ask rather < br > hastili . < br > < br > “ no , i do not mean that , ” and she spoke in a low voic as if talk to < br > herself . “ i have enjoy it . i suppos i am veri queer and shock , < br > but i shall look back to thi experi all my life and be glad that < br > it came to me. ” < br > < br > the shipmast wonder how much she meant . her inton told him < br > that it wa someth person and intim . perhap other women had < br > made love to captain michael o ’ shea , but never one like nora forb . < br > amid circumst so strang and exot , so utterli remov from the < br > normal scheme of thing , it wa as natur as breath that speech < br > should be sincer and emot genuin . < br > < br > o ’ shea had a curious delic sens of honor . he could not forget < br > gerald van steen . nora had promis to marri him . steer the < br > convers away from danger ground , he said : < br > < br > “ i have chang me opinion of mr. van steen . he ha behav veri well . < br > he did not understand us at first. ” < br > < br > nora wa not as interest as befor , and repli rather carelessli : < br > < br > “ he ha work hard becaus you and mr. kent compel him to. ” < br > < br > “ you are not fair to him , ” warmli return o ’ shea . “ there is not a man < br > in the crew that ha stood up to it ani better . nor am i warp in hi < br > favor , for i will own up that he rub me the wrong way at first. ” < br > < br > “ of cours , i have admir the way he handl himself on board the < br > _fearless_ , ” admit nora , her conscienc uneasi that she should be < br > so laggard a champion . “ but i hardli expect to hear you sing hi < br > prais , captain o ’ shea. ” < br > < br > “ whi not ? i would give me dearest enemi hi desert ” -- he hesit and < br > bluntli ad -- “ and then if he got in my way i would do me best to wipe < br > him off the map. ” < br > < br > “ if he got in your way ? ” murmur nora . “ i should hate to be the man < br > that stood in your way. ” < br > < br > “ if there is to be straight talk between us , ” demand o ’ shea , “ tell < br > me whi ye show no more pleasur that thi voyag ha knock the < br > foolish out of van steen and made a two-fist man of him ? when he < br > came aboard he wa an imit man that had been spoil by hi money . < br > he is differ now . can ye not see it for yourself ? ” < br > < br > “ ye , i see it , ” repli nora , regard o ’ shea with a demeanor oddli < br > perplex . he wa not play the game to her like . the interview < br > had been twist to lead her into a blind alley . with a petul < br > exclam , she walk briskli toward the farther end of the key . < br > o ’ shea follow , admir , cogit . < br > < br > overtak her , he indic a broken topmast wash ashor from some < br > tall sailing-ship , and they found seat upon it . the hypnot spell < br > of the sea took hold of them both until nora turn and protestingli < br > exclaim : < br > < br > “ aren ’ t you fear tire of see noth but thi great , blue , < br > empti expans of salt water ? ” < br > < br > “ my eye could never tire if i had you to look at , ” said he , not by way < br > of make love to her , but as a simpl statement of fact . < br > < br > nora appear happier . thi buccan of her wa becom more < br > tractabl , but he pervers haul about on anoth tack and ad : < br > < br > “ as long as there are ship to sail the sea , there will be men to go < br > in them , men that will never tire of salt water though it treat them < br > cruel . they will hear the voic of sweetheart and wive on shore , but < br > they will not listen . the hand of littl children will beckon , but < br > they will not stay . ’ ti fine to be warm and dri in a hous , and to see < br > the green thing grow , and men and women live like christian , but if < br > you are the seafarin ’ kind , you must find a ship and put out of port < br > again . i am one of those that will never tire of it , miss forb . poor < br > old johnni kent is differ . he sit and sigh for hi farm and will < br > talk you deaf about it . my father wa a shipmast befor me , and hi < br > peopl were fishermen in the western islands. ” < br > < br > nora sigh . o ’ shea ’ s caress voic rose and fell with a sort of < br > melancholi rhythm , an inherit from hi celtic forebear . it wa as < br > though he were chant a farewel to her . her love , lumin eye < br > were suffus . the wind wa warm and soft , but she shiver slightli . < br > < br > “ we had better turn back to the camp , ” said she . “ my aunt will be < br > look for me. ” < br > < br > they walk along the shine beach , think mani thing which could < br

that he should have < br > been an unwit eavesdropp . it wa most emphat none of hi < br > busi . hi cheek redden , howev , and he felt gusti anger that < br > nora should be taken to task for stroll to the end of the key with < br > him . < br > < br > “ a jealou man is the most unreason work of god , ” he said to < br > himself . “ ’ twa a harmless walk we had. ” < br > < br > duti divert captain o ’ shea from consid the disturb emot < br > of gerald van steen . ration must be measur out and inspect , the < br > muster roll call , the sick visit , and the sentri appoint for < br > the night . he had finish these task and wa stand near hi tent < br > when van steen approach in a hurri , angri manner . surmis the < br > caus , o ’ shea caught him by the arm and led him in the direct of the < br > beach , away from the curiou eye and ear of the camp . < br > < br > van steen wrench himself free with a threaten gestur . he had < br > work himself into a passion childishli irrat . o ’ shea wa < br > inwardli amus , but hi face wa grave as he inquir : < br > < br > “ whi these hostil symptom ? do not shout it all over the place . tell < br > it to me easi and get it out of your system. ” < br > < br > thi casual recept rather stump young mr. van steen . he gulp , < br > made a fals start or two , and sullenli repli : < br > < br > “ you and i will have it out as man to man , o ’ shea. ” < br > < br > “ _captain_ o ’ shea , if ye pleas , while i command thi expedit , ” < br > softli spoke the other . “ as man to man ? you have been a man onli sinc < br > i took charg of your educ . are ye sure you are readi to qualifi ? ” < br > < br > the shipmast ’ s smile wa frosti , and hi glanc wa exceedingli < br > alert . van steen rais hi voic to an unsteadi pitch as he cri : < br > < br > “ that is a cheap insult . it show what you are under the skin . now , i < br > don ’ t propos to bring her -- to bring ani one ’ s name into thi -- but you < br > are to keep away , understand ? it ha to stop. ” < br > < br > “ did ani one request ye to tell me to keep away , as ye put it in your < br > tact way ? ” blandli suggest o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ no ; thi is my affair . there ha been enough of thi blarney < br > nonsens of your , and watch for a chanc when my back is turn . if < br > you were a gentleman , there would be no necess of tell you this. ” < br > < br > the veneer had been quit thoroughli remov from the convent < br > surfac of gerald ten eyck van steen . he wa the primit man readi < br > to fight for hi woman . o ’ shea wa divid between respect for him and < br > a desir to swing a fist against hi jaw . < br > < br > “ we have no gentlemen in my trade , of cours , ” he retort . “ now and < br > then we pick up one of them adrift and do our best for him , and he < br > turn to and blackguard us for our pain . have ye more to say ? ” < br > < br > “ consider more . it is an aw awkward matter to discuss , but it < br > is my right , and -- and -- -- ” < br > < br > o ’ shea interrupt vehement : < br > < br > “ the hot sun ha addl your brain . for heaven ’ s sake , stop where you < br > are . if it wa me intent to make love to the girl and tri to win her < br > for myself , i would go straight to you . you would not have to come to < br > me. ” < br > < br > “ you are a liar and a sneak , and i think you are a coward unless you < br > have your men at your back , ” almost scream van steen . < br > < br > “ which i will take from no man , ” return o ’ shea , and he swung from the < br > shoulder and stretch the young man flat on the

order the men back to camp , and then quizzic < br > survey the daze champion . < br > < br > “ you will fight a duel with me or i ’ ll shoot you , ” cri van steen . “ at < br > daylight to-morrow -- with revolv -- at the other end of the key. ” < br > < br > “ i will not ! ” curtli repli o ’ shea . “ ye might put a hole through me , < br > and what good would that do ? ’ ti my busi to get these peopl away , < br > and keep them aliv in the meantim . as for shoot me inform , if < br > i catch you with a gun i will clap ye in irons. ” < br > < br > “ but you knock me down twice , ” protest van

“ never more so , ma ’ am , ” and he ad , with seem irrelev , “ i < br > suppos you have heard that cap ’ n o ’ shea and mr. van steen came near < br > fightin ’ a duel yesterday afternoon. ” < br > <

which she < br > still stood . it appeal to her with an indefin patho . she could < br > not understand whi , but she began to weep , although a moment befor she < br > had perceiv the wild absurd of johnni ’ s kent argument . < br > < br > “ whi , you ain ’ t suppos to cri , ” he exclaim in great agit ; “ i ’ m < br > tri to pleas you. ” < br > < br > “ i -- i -- can see your good intent , ” she

o ’ shea laid a hand upon hi comrad ’ s shoulder and wa move to < br > sympathi . < br > < br > “ you are make heavi weather of it , johnni . suppos i forbid thi < br > high-tragedi duel . i am still

will < br > talk about it to-night. ” < br > < br > “ you ’ re the boss , cap ’ n mike , and i ’ d hate to mutini on you , but i ’ ve < br > pass my word to the finest ladi in the world that thi duel would be < br > fought . and a man that will break hi word to a ladi ought to be strung < br > to the yard-arm. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea walk away and sat down in front of hi tent . the cuban < br > camp wa buzz with excit , and a grumbl uneasi wa < br > manifest among the crew of the _fearless_ . the two faction cordial < br > dislik each other . the stori of the duel had spread like a fire . if < br > anyth happen to johnni kent , the _fearless_ men were resolv to < br > annihil the cuban camp . such intent be promptli convey to < br > the patriot , they swarm about colonel calvo and announc their < br > readi to aveng him with the last drop of their blood . < br > < br > o ’ shea summon jack gorham as hi most depend aid and counsellor . < br > the melancholi sharp-shoot listen respect . o ’ shea wax < br > torrid and hi languag wa strong . < br > < br > “ johnni kent is a great engin and i swear by him , ” he declar , “ but < br > he is full to the hatch with sentiment , and it make him as cranki < br > as a wet hen . he is dead set on thi comic duel , and i dislik to < br > disgrac him by put him under arrest . he would never sail with me < br > again. ” < br > < br > “ better let them fight , ” said gorham . < br > < br > “ ’ ti your trade , ” repli o ’ shea . “ you are biass . i want ye to < br > figur a way to make thi duel harmless . let them shoot all they like , < br

is thi pistol parti schedul to happen ? ” ask gorham . < br > < br > “ earli to-morrow morning. ” < br > < br > “ it will be easi enough to steal their revolv while they ’ re asleep , < br > sir , and work the bullet out of the shell and spill most of the < br > powder . or i could file down the front sight . whi not make ’ em < br > postpon it for anoth twenty-four hour ? the second will have a lot < br > of pow-wowin ’ to do , and perhap we can work out a better scheme. ” < br > < br > “ i agre with you , gorham . a duel should be conduct with a great deal < br > of etiquett and deliber . ’ ti not a rough-and-tumbl scrap , but < br > more like a declar of war . we will do it proper , even if we are < br > rag and shipwrecked. ” < br > < br > shortli thereaft captain o ’ shea issu hi ultimatum to the < br > combat . they were to observ a truce until the morn of the < br > second day . meanwhil negoti would be conduct in a dignifi < br > and befit manner . violat of thi edict would be punish by < br > confin under guard . johnni kent grumbl volubl until o ’ shea < br > convinc him that the etiquett of the duell code forbad unseemli < br > hast . < br > < br > “ i take your word for it , cap ’ n mike . i don ’ t want to make ani break . < br > thi affair aim to be strictli accordin ’ to hoyle. ” < br > < br > < br > v < br > < br > shortli after sunris next morn the sentri , the cook , and a few < br > sailor and cuban who were earli astir discov a faint smudg < br > of smoke on the horizon to the northward . they shout the tide , < br > and captain o ’ shea tumbl out of hi tent , rub hi eye . a long < br > scrutini convinc him that the steamer wa head to pass within < br > sight distanc of the key . she wa come from the direct of < br > the cuban coast . possibl she might belong to the spanish navi . on < br > the other hand , she might be a cargo tramp bound to the southward and < br > seek a south american port . < br > < br > there is such a thing as becom accustom to the unexpect . those < br > who dwell in the midst of alarm acquir a certain philosoph temper < br > which view life as a seri of hazard . on thi lone key in the < br > caribbean the daili routin of thing had run along without acut < br > symptom of worri and dread , although the peril of discoveri by a < br > spanish war-vessel wa discuss by the even camp-fir . so long as < br > captain o ’ shea appear unruffl , hi follow saw no reason whi they < br > should lose sleep . to him it wa like the toss of a coin . they were to < br > be rescu or they were to be found by the enemi . < br > < br > if he had seem inact , it wa becaus thi wa an extraordinari < br > shipwreck . to send the life-raft in search of succor wa a forlorn < br > hope , a desper expedi , but even thi wa deni him . the wind wa < br > blow steadili from the southward , day after day , and the raft would < br > drift straight toward the coast of cuba where no merci wa to be look < br > for . becaus of the destruct of the spanish gun-boat , these refuge < br > were someth els than castaway . they were men without a countri , < br > and death await them wherev flew the red and yellow flag of spain . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea turn from gaze at the distant smoke and awaken < br > johnni kent . < br > < br > “ rous out , ye sleepi old duellist , ” he call . “ take a look at thi < br > vessel. ” < br > < br > the engin emerg from the tent and the two men stood side by side , < br > their emot weight with poignant anxieti . < br > < br > “ we won ’ t be abl to tell what she is for some time yet , ” said johnni < br > kent . “ the sea is hazi . ye , she ’ s sure enough comin ’ thi way , cap ’ n < br > mike. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti best for us to be readi , whatev she is , ” repli o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ i guess we ’ ll postpon the arrang for my duel . what ’ s the < br > order ? ” < br > < br > “ all hand will move insid the earthwork right after breakfast , ” < br > briskli spoke o ’ shea . “ take charg of the men in your depart , < br > johnni . see that the rifl are clean and serv out plenti of < br > ammunit . and store all the fresh water ye can. ” < br > < br > “ if it ’ s a spanish vessel , can we stand her off at all , cap ’ n mike ? ” < br > < br > “ she will have a hard time shellin ’ us out , johnni . that four-sid < br > refug we pile up with our shovel is noth but a big sand-bank . < br > shell will buri in it without explodin ’ . ’ ti the theori of modern < br > fortif . we can do our best , and mayb luck will turn our way . < br > anyhow , ’ ti more sensibl than to be shot by drum-head court-marti , < br > which is what will happen to us if we throw up our hand and surrend . < br > if they find us a hard nut to crack , perhap we can make term of some < br > kind. ” < br > < br > “ what about the ladi ? i wa hopin ’ they wouldn ’ t have to go up < br > against ani more excit , ” wist said johnni kent . < br > < br > “ i have deliv me cargo . it stand no longer between us and our < br > guest , johnni . and ’ ti my opinion that you and i will not let them < br > suffer for the sake of save our own skins. ” < br > < br > “ right you are , cap ’ n mike . i don ’ t care a cuss what becom of me if < br > you can get miss hollist -- i mean both of ’ em , of cours -- on board a < br > respect vessel of some kind. ” < br > < br > soon the camp wa in commot . the method of the leader were brutal < br > and direct . thi wa no time for soft word . jack gorham move quietli , < br > in sever place at onc , and when a man would argu or expostul he < br > wa threaten with the butt of that terribl springfield . at hi side , < br > like a huge , black shadow , stalk jiminez , a milit assist who < br > jump at the word of command . < br > < br > johnni kent , no longer a sigh sentimentalist , bellow at hi < br > engin , oiler , and stoker , and the disciplin of shipboard took < br > hold of them . there wa the loudest uproar in the cuban camp . becaus < br > of their race , the patriot had to be melodramat , to defi the unknown < br > steamer by run to the beach and brandish their rifl and < br > machet at the ribbon of smoke that trail across the opalesc sea . < br > but colonel calvo , veri much more of a man in thi emerg than when < br > he had been afloat on the bound billow , drove them back to camp and < br > got them well in hand . < br > < br > the canva shelter were hastili rip down and set up insid the < br > earthwork as a protect against the sun which blaze into thi < br > windless enclosur with fierc intens . johnni kent paus to say to < br > o ’ shea : < br > < br > “ it ’ s goin ’ to be hade in there for the women . they can ’ t stand it < br > long. ” < br > < br > “ they won ’ t have to , johnni . thi will be a short perform . ye can < br > expect a show-down between now and sunset. ” < br > < br > the haze had vanish . the steamer wa visibl beneath a far-flung < br > banner of smoke . a tini foremast , a ring around it , and o ’ shea < br > exclaim : < br > < br > “ a fighting-top ! it look to me like the cruiser that chase us down < br > the coast. ” < br > < br > “ that ’ s her , dollar to doughnut , cap ’ n mike . she ain ’ t in such a < br > hurri to-day. ” < br > < br > “ no need of it . we can ’ t get away. ” < br > < br > “ do you think she ’ s realli lookin ’ for us ? ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti not a bad guess , johnni . as soon as word wa telegraph to < br > havana that the gun-boat wa destroy , the whole blockadin ’ fleet must < br > have been order to watch for us at both end of cuba . they knew we < br > had to round cape maysi or san antonio to get home . and when we were < br > not seen or report anywher they may have begun to look for us down < br > here to the south ’ ard. ” < br > < br > “ she can ’ t help sightin ’ the wreck of the _fearless_ , ” said the < br > engin . < br > < br > “ and then she will know who we are . ’ ti time for all hand to take to < br > cover. ” < br > < br > the spanish man-of-war , gray , and slim , and venom , slowli lift her < br > hull abov the sea-lin , and wa head to pass to the eastward of the < br > sandi islet . it wa a fair conjectur that her captain wa rove away < br > from hi station on the coast in the hope of find the _fearless_ < br > disabl or short of coal . some of the refuge surmis that she might < br > pass them unobserv , but at a distanc of two or three mile she < br > turn and laid a cours to pick up the key at closer rang . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea climb the rampart and lash an american ensign to a < br > spar thrust into the sand . the bright flag wa neither half-mast nor < br > revers as a signal of distress . the breez flaunt it as a defianc , < br > a messag from men who had forfeit it protect , who cheer the < br > sight of it for sentiment reason which they could not have clearli < br > explain . the govern of the unit state and spain were at < br > peac . thi wa not an affair between the two power . it wa a littl < br > privat war , a singular incid . and yet it wa somehow fit , after < br > all , that these outlaw should prefer to see the star and stripe < br > wave over their head . < br > < br > present colonel calvo plant besid thi ensign the tricolor of the < br > cuban revolutionari , with the lone star . it wa done with a certain < br > amount of ceremoni which command respect and admir . it signifi < br > that he , too , speak for hi men , wa readi to make the last stand , < br > to accept the decre of fortun . johnni kent grasp hi hand and < br > apolog . < br > < br > the cruiser move cautious nearer the key , take frequent sound . < br > the wreck of the _fearless_ had been discov and must have been < br > identifi , for the cruiser clear for action , and the bugl trill < br > on her deck . the huge , four-sid mound of sand heap upon the back < br > of the key evid puzzl the offic . after a long delay , the < br > vessel let go an anchor a thousand yard from the beach and spite < br > hurl sever shell into the shatter hulk of the _fearless_ . < br > < br > then a pair of eight-inch turret-gun were train at captain < br > o ’ shea ’ s thick wall of sand . a string of small flag flutter from < br > the cruiser ’ s signal-yard . o ’ shea comprehend the messag without < br > consult the intern code-book . < br > < br > “ she invit us to surrend , ” he explain , “ which i declin to do at < br > present . let her shoot away . mayb she will tire of it and leav us. ” < br > < br > no white flag wa display on the rampart , and the cruiser lost < br > her temper . a projectil pass over the key with a nois like a < br > derail freight-train . other follow until the sand wa spurt < br > in yellow geyser . such shell as struck the earthwork burrow deep < br > hole without caus appreci damag . the spanish command soon < br > perceiv that thi impromptu fortif wa costli to bombard . < br > hi gunner were mere buri shell in a larg heap of sand , and < br > hi govern had not been lavish in fill hi magazin . a mortar < br > batteri wa need to discommod thi insan crew of pirat . and < br > undoubtedli , if a landing-parti should be disembark on the open < br > beach , these rascal of captain o ’ shea would fight like devil . the < br > cruiser had been order to fetch them back to havana aliv and they < br > would be formal execut in the cabaña fortress as a warn to < br > other hardi seafar in the filibust trade . these men had not < br > onli fire on the spanish flag , but they had also blown it out of water . < br > < br > but how were they to be extract from their refug without sacrif < br > the live of spanish sailor and marin ? _carramba_ , here wa a tough < br > problem ! < br > < br > it might be feasibl to starv them out by mean of a sieg , but the < br > cruiser had no abund of coal and store . a storm would compel her < br > to steam out to sea , or run for the coast . and if the key were left < br > unguard a merchant-vessel might happen along and rescu o ’ shea and < br > hi men . and for all the command knew , they had alreadi sent a boat < br > to summon help . < br > < br > the cruiser ceas fire . thereupon captain o ’ shea conven a council < br > of war within hi defenc . the enclosur had been delug with fli < br > sand , but there were no casualti . < br > < br > “ there will be no more bombard , ” he told hi peopl . “ the cruiser < br > will do one of two thing . she will lay off the key and wait for us to < br > give in , or she will send her boat ashor to-night and tri to rush us < br > in the dark. ” < br > < br > “ we ’ ll make it unhealthi for ’ em , ” stoutli declar johnni kent . < br > < br > “ me and my men will die for _cuba libre_ , ” said colonel calvo , hi < br > theatric manner fled , hi word spoken with a fine simplic . < br > < br > “ there don ’ t seem to be ani way out , ” observ jack gorham . < br > < br > o ’ shea gaze at them in silenc . there wa no reproach in their speech < br > or manner , no thought of blame him for thi tragic predica . and < br > yet it wa hi respons and hi alon . he might have abandon < br > the _fearless_ in the bay and taken these peopl ashor where they < br > could find refug with the cuban armi of gomez . if he had been guilti < br > of an error of judgment , then he should pay the price . there dawn < br > upon him a clear concept of hi own privat duti . < br > < br > “ we will stick it out as we are till sunset , ” he said abruptli . < br > “ noth more can happen befor then . how are the ladi , johnni ? ” < br > < br > “ i ’ m afraid they ’ ll go under if we have mani day like thi , cap ’ n < br > mike . thi is an infern place to be coop up in. ” < br > < br > “ i am asham to face them , johnni . ’ ti all my fault that they are in < br > thi mess with us . i should have put them ashor when i had the chanc . < br > but a sailor will think of hi ship when he can save her , and ’ ti hi < br > chronic notion that he is safer at sea than anywher else. ” < br > < br > through the long , long day the sun pour wickedli into the < br > fortif . the cruiser roll lazili at her anchorag and made no < br > sign of renew the attack . o ’ shea lay flat behind a small embrasur < br > and vainli search the sea for the sight of a merchant-steam which < br > might interven in behalf of the castaway . thi wa hi last hope . < br > < br > with a weari sigh he watch the red sun slant lower and lower . hi < br > lucki star had fail him . he made hi decis . present he beckon < br > gerald van steen and ask him to go outsid the fortif , where < br > they could have speech in privat . the young man wa sullen , but o ’ shea < br > smile with engag friendli and said : < br > < br > “ ’ ti no time to nurs grudg , me lad . let us shake hand and forget < br > it. ” < br > < br > “ oh , i ’ m not think of that row of our , ” wearili mutter van steen . < br > “ it ’ s of no consequ now . i ’ m not such a howl cad as to consid < br > myself in ani way . what do you propos to do with miss forb and miss < br > hollist ? i have kept my mouth shut all day , wait for the great < br > captain mike o ’ shea to do what would have occur to ani man with hi < br > wit about him. ” < br > < br > “ may i ask what it is that ye would call so plain to see ? ” patient < br > queri the shipmast . < br > <

explain matter to the command < br > and show him my credenti . i don ’ t want to be a quitter , you know , < br > but realli thi is none of my affair , and my first duti is to get these < br > ladi home in safety. ” < br > < br > “ i grant ye that , ” slowli repli o ’ shea . “ and i think no less of you < br > for wish to leav us to stew in our own juic . you have behav veri < br > well , bar the one flare-up with me . now i will explain whi what < br > ye suggest is not so easi . the cruiser would pay no heed to signal < br > about you . ’ twould be look at as some kind of a trick . can ye not < br > realiz that the master of the navi vessel yonder is wild with rage to < br > extermin me and the rest of the _fearless_ compani ? he see red , < br > man . as for send ye on the life-raft , it mean that sever of me < br > own men must go with you to handl the lubberli thing . and they would < br > be drag aboard the cruiser and held there . i wa will to go < br > meself , but i could not navig the raft so short-hand . and i hope < br > the luck might turn befor night. ” < br > < br > van steen had lost hi hostil express . he regret hi hasti word < br > of condemn . the inton of o ’ shea ’ s voic strang move him . < br > and the sailor ’ s face , no longer bold and reckless , held a certain < br > qualiti of gentl , one might almost call it sweet . < br > < br > “ oh , confound it ! ” cri van steen . “ you put me in the wrong , as usual . < br > and i ’ m damn if i can feel squar in tri to quit you and leav < br > you to take your medicin . i am one of the crowd , don ’ t you see , and < br > proud of it . they are a bulli sort. ” < br > < br > “ i have never been crowd into such a tight corner , ” said o ’ shea with < br > a smile , “ but ’ ti the way of life that when a man is young and strong , < br > and use to long chanc , he think he will not be trip . thi is my < br > affair , not your , so troubl yourself no more. ” < br > < br > “ what do you propos to do , captain o ’ shea ? you have made up your mind , < br > i can see that. ” < br > < br > “ the cruiser will be in a mood to hold commun with us now . < br > ’ twould have been useless to tri it thi morn . but they have < br > discov that ’ ti not easi to smoke us out of our hole. ” < br > < br > present he unrol a bundl of signal-flag save from the < br > _fearless_ , and select those he wish to use . knot them < br > togeth , he hoist the string on the spar beneath the american < br > ensign . the command of the cruiser read the messag request that < br > a boat be sent ashor in order to discuss term of surrend . he wa < br > in no mood to discuss term of ani kind , but it appear necessari < br > to parley with these unspeak scoundrel on the key . perhap they < br > realiz the hopeless of their obstinaci and their spirit wa < br > broken . < br > < br > a cutter wa man , and as it skim over the calm sea and drew < br > near the breaker captain o ’ shea walk to the beach , colonel calvo < br > accompani him as interpret . van steen follow as a right < br > particip in the confer . the ladi were request to remain < br > within the fortif . it wa not to be taken for grant that the < br > cruiser would respect a truce . the seamen and the cuban behind the < br > bank of sand were savag and desper , as wa to be expect of men < br > for whom surrend meant the firing-squad . < br > < br > the crew of the cutter held her off the beach as the part of caution . < br > they were readi to pull out to sea at a moment ’ s notic . o ’ shea and < br > colonel calvo splash into the water and stood besid the boat . the < br > command himself wa in the stern-sheet , a corpul , black-beard < br > man of an explos temper . he wait , glower , for o ’ shea to speak . < br > he would wast no courtesi on pirat . < br > < br > “ you will play fair with me , ” said the shipmast , and colonel calvo < br > translat as well as he wa abl . “ i have ye cover with fifti < br > rifl . i am captain michael o ’ shea . ye may have heard tell of me. ” < br > < br > the command nod and profan repli that he knew noth good of < br > captain o ’ shea or the _fearless_ . it wa an act of god that they would < br > make no more voyag . < br > < br > “ much oblig for your kind wish , ” resum o ’ shea . “ i am sorri to < br > have put you to so much troubl . i will wast no more word . i have in < br > me parti the young man stand yonder on the beach and two ladi that < br > i pick up adrift from a strand american yacht . ’ ti not right for < br > them to suffer ani longer . i want ye to carri them to port. ” < br > < br > the command had heard of no wreck yacht in these water . as for the < br > women , it wa most unfortun for them . captain o ’ shea had onli to < br > surrend hi forc and the women would be taken on board the cruiser < br > and properli provid for . then the stori could be investig . < br > < br > o ’ shea broke in angrili to say to colonel calvo : < br > < br > “ he is like a mad bull . there is no reason in him at all . he will make < br > us surrend sooner , he think , to save the ladi . he will use ani < br > weapon that come to hand. ” < br

< br > marta bay , and he die with hi vessel . by the blood of god , shall i < br > parley with you ? ” < br > < br > gerald van steen wade out to the boat . he would speak for himself . < br > that there should be ani question of rescu nora forb and miss < br > hollist fairli stun him . hi bear wa intrepid , but hi lip < br > quiver as he imploringli exclaim to colonel calvo : < br > < br > “ tell him that i don ’ t care a hang about what happen to me if he will < br > take the women off . and if money will tempt him , i ’ ll pay down my last < br > dollar to save the live of the whole parti . he will be a rich man. ” < br > < br > the spanish offic laugh with a contemptu shrug . hi heavi < br > visag wa inflam . he wa of that type of hi race which regard < br > american as “ yanke pigs. ” person hatr and the desir of privat < br > vengeanc made him proof against briberi . moreov , he had no faith in < br > the protest of van steen . as o ’ shea had put it , he wa a man who < br > saw red . the futil of appeal to him wa so obviou that o ’ shea < br > interf to play hi trump card . < br > < br > “ if you land your sailor to-night and tri to take us , ” said he , and < br > hi voic wa hard and deliber , “ ’ twill be the toughest job ye ever < br > tackl . we have noth to lose , and we will be behind the earthwork < br > yonder . you can gambl that there will be two dead spaniard for everi < br > one of us ye wipe out . as for starv us , i have thought it over , and < br > ye will not tri it . you would be laugh at from havana to madrid for < br > not dare to attack a hand of shipwreck men . ye have a dilemma < br > by the horn . and your rage ha made ye blind as a bat . you are all < br > for give us a short shrift , and no doubt your hot-head offici < br > in havana have eg ye on to it . but it will make a big diplomat < br > row , and when the smoke clear ye will be sorri . it will sound veri < br > rotten that ye had no merci on a crew of castaway . and i will say , for < br > your own inform , that uncl sam ha been veri touchi about these < br > quick-act execut ever sinc the _virginius_ affair. ” < br > < br > the command had ceas to fume . he wa do o ’ shea the favor of < br > listen to him . the stronger person had made an impress . < br > o ’ shea perceiv thi and he went on to say : < br > < br > “ what i am lead up to is thi : -- i am readi to surrend meself and < br > face the consequ if you will take my guest aboard and leav my < br > men and the cuban on the key . they will take chanc of be found by < br > a friendli vessel . you will lose no live . i am the man your govern < br > want . you will win the big reward offer for the captur of captain < br > michael o ’ shea . and there will be no complic between your < br > govern and mine . ’ ti me own fault that the parti is strand here . < br > i will pay the price . ’ twill be easi enough for ye to explain it . you < br > can keep your crew quiet , and the stori will go out that ye took me off < br > the wreck of my steamer and the other got away. ” < br > < br > thi wa a propos which took the command all aback . he consid < br > it in silenc and hi gaze wa less unfriendli . o ’ shea conclud with < br > dog vehem : < br > < br > “ you can take it or leav it . if you refus , you must come and take < br > us , and , so help me , as i tell ye , it will cost you a slather of men < br > befor ye wipe out my outfit. ” < br > < br > here wa a lawless castaway , a man beyond the pale , who insol < br > defi the arm and majesti of spain . but there wa a certain plausibl < br > method in hi mad which caus the command to waver . hi < br > implac hostil had sensibl diminish . it would , without doubt , < br > win him great distinct to return to havana with the redoubt < br > captain michael o ’ shea a prison . as for the men of the outlaw < br > parti , most of them had been invis from the cruiser , and their < br > number wa a mere matter of conjectur . it wa therefor possibl for < br > the command to inform hi offic that in accept the surrend < br > of captain o ’ shea he had captur all of the expedit that wa worth < br > while seiz . he had serv thirti year in the spanish navi without < br > see a man slain by bullet or shell . the prospect of a fierc and < br > bloodi engag with men who would fight like wolv fail to arous < br > hi enthusiasm . < br > < br > “ i will signal my answer in one hour , ” said he . “ what you propos ha < br > surpris me . it is most unusu . it wa not expected. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea wade ashor and colonel calvo offer hi hand as they stood < br > on the beach and watch the cutter dip it flash oar in the < br > ground-swel . < br > < br > “ i have dislik ’ you sometim , ” said the colonel . “ but now i tell you < br > i have been much wrong . i will be ver ’ proud to go with you to havana < br > if it will save the live of my brave ’ of soldiers. ” < br > < br > “ you are a good man yourself when ye have terra firma under you , ” wa < br > the hearti respons . < br > < br > johnni kent came trot to meet them , exclaim beseechingli : < br > < br > “ what wa it all about , cap ’ n mike ? whi couldn ’ t you put me next befor < br > you flew the signal ? ” < br > < br > o ’ shea painstakingli retold the argument which he had unfold to < br > the spanish command , and the chief engin listen with hi chin < br > prop in hi hand . he breath heavili and grunt disapprov . < br > < br > “ but what els wa i to do ? ” impati demand o ’ shea . “ i got you < br > all into thi , and i must get you out . and mayb i have found a way. ” < br > < br > “ that ain ’ t what i ’ m growlin ’ about , ” strenuous protest johnni < br > kent . “ whi didn ’ t you let me in on thi deal ? whi not let me surrend < br > with you ? doggon it , i ’ m no slouch of a pirat myself , with < br > consider of a reput . perhap the spaniard might think i wa < br > worth bargainin ’ for , too. ” < br > < br > “ i want to go it alon , johnni . ’ ti the onli squar thing to do. ” < br > < br > “ but you and me have been playin ’ the game togeth , cap ’ n mike . and < br > you don ’ t ketch me layin ’ down on you just becaus you ’ ve come to the < br > end of your rope. ” < br > < br > “ not thi time , johnni . ’ ti onli make us feel bad to wrangl about < br > it. ” < br > < br > the castaway had ceas to gaze at the encircl horizon for sight of < br > smoke or sail . it came , therefor , as an incred thing when a sentri < br > at an embrasur yell and caper like a lunat . everi one rush out < br > and beheld the black hull and tower upper-work of a huge passeng < br > steamer . she wa come up from the westward and had alter her track < br > as though curiou to discov whi the spanish cruiser should be at < br > anchor near the key . would she halt or pass on her way ? captain o ’ shea , < br > unabl to credit hi vision , told hi men to fire volley , and ran up < br > the signal-flag to read : < br > < br > “ _stand by . we need assistance._ ” < br > < br > it wa more than he dare hope that the steamer would read hi call for < br > help , but she drew nearer and nearer the key , slow speed , and round < br > to within a few hundr yard of the spanish cruiser . < br > < br > “ it ’ s a british vessel , a white star liner , ” bawl johnni kent . “ what < br > is she doin ’ in these water ? ” < br > < br > “ one of those winter-excurs cruiser out of new york , i take it , ” < br > repli o ’ shea . “ she is make a short cut across from the leeward < br > island or somewher below us , run from port to port . i hope she < br > will realiz that thi is no holiday excurs for us. ” < br > < br > the refuge made littl nois . they were no longer actor but < br > spectat . they saw the liner exchang signal with the cruiser . < br > appar thi method of commun wa unsatisfactori , for soon < br > a boat pass between the two vessel . there follow a heart-break < br > delay . dusk wa obscur the sea when a yawl pull by a dozen british < br > seamen move from the liner ’ s side and danc toward the key . the < br > rampart of sand were instantli desert . o ’ shea ’ s men and the cuban < br > ran wildli to the beach , no longer afraid , confid that salvat had < br > come to them . they rush into the water and drag the stout yawl < br > high and dri . < br > < br > there step ashor a stalwart , energet man in the smart uniform < br > of a captain in the white star servic . the crowd fell back as he < br > brusqu demand : < br > < br > “ what kind of a queer busi is thi ? where is the chief pirat ? ” < br > < br > “ o ’ shea is me name , ” acknowledg the leader . “ ’ ti quit a yarn , if ye < br > have time and patienc to hear it. ” < br > < br > “ so you are o ’ shea , ” and the skipper of the _caronic_ chuckl . “ take < br > me insid that extraordinari sand-heap of your , if you pleas , and < br > talk as long as you like. ” < br > < br > he grasp o ’ shea ’ s arm and they vanish within the empti defenc . < br > < br > “ i have come ashor to get at the bottom of thi fantast < br > situat , ” said captain henderson of the _caronic_ , whose smile wa < br > both friendli and humor . “ the command of the spanish cruiser told < br > me to keep my hand off and to go about my busi . cheeki , wasn ’ t it ? < br > he swore he had a nest of bloodi pirat corner on thi key , and he < br > expect to captur them to-night. ” < br > < br > “ so he decid to turn down my proposit , ” mutter o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ he refer to it . but hi offic were keen to win a bit of glori < br > for themselv , and they argu him the other way round , as i figur < br > it from hi heat remark . he didn ’ t relish the job of sail into < br > you chap . in fact , the black-whisk don wa in a state of mind . are < br > you , by ani chanc , a british subject ? ” < br > < br > “ no , captain henderson , but i might find ye a british or two among me < br > crew . i have an assort compani of gentlemen of fortune. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea explain matter at some length , and captain henderson < br > vehement interrupt to say : < br > < br > “ i don ’ t know that it make a lot of differ whether you are british < br > subject or not . blood is thicker than water . shall i steam away and < br > leav you to be shot on the say-so of a rave spanish skipper ? ” < br > < br > “ i should be disappoint in you if ye did , ” grave answer o ’ shea . < br > “ ’ ti not what i would do for you. ” < br > < br > the master of the _caronic_ permit o ’ shea to finish hi narr . < br > < br > “ so you pick up the van steen parti ? ” he rap out . “ we heard of the < br > loss of the _morn star_ . the spanish skipper out yonder said i might < br > take them off in my ship befor he attack you. ” < br > < br > “ and what do ye propos to do about us ? ” wist ask o ’ shea . “ of < br > cours thi is none of your row , and your ship is not a british navi < br > vessel -- -- ” < br

want to know. ” < br > < br > “ and ye will take us off ? ” < br > < br > “ at onc . and i imagin i had better land you in a british port . what < br > about jamaica ? ” < br > < br > “ jamaica will suit us , captain henderson . the unit state will not be < br > salubri for us until thi piraci charg blow over . and the cuban < br > can dodg across to their nativ land . but what will ye do if the < br > spanish cruiser object ? ” < br > < br > “ she will not fire on my flag , ” thunder the master of the _caronic_ , < br > “ nor will she dare to take shipwreck men from my deck . tell your < br

evacu with the honor of war , and the < br > american ensign wa left fli abov the huge heap of sand . < br > < br > disinclin to join the jubil , captain michael o ’ shea wander < br > away from hi seamen and stood gaze at the liner whose light were < br > blaze like a great hotel . nora forb walk along the beach until < br > she came to him . he wait for her to speak . < br > < br > “ i saw you

glen_ steamer just now ? do you < br > happen to know the vessel ? i can ’ t place her. ” < br > < br > johnni kent grunt as if he had sat upon a tack and answer with < br > heat emphasi : < br > < br

glimps of captain handi stand stolidli between hi < br > majesti and the minist of financ , and heard him huskili declaim : < br > < br > “ the _tyneshir glen_ is a bargain at thirti thousand pound , and you < br > needn ’ t take my word for it . baron strother here ha interview the < br > broker that have her for sale , and he know the price they put on her. ” < br > < br > “ i have full confid

no case of barnacl on the intellect , ” wa the verdict of < br > o ’ shea , “ barrin ’ the fact that he ought to have more sens than to < br > listen to the palav of a rascal like thi captain handi . whi didn ’ t < br > we think to follow them up and see where they went ? ” < br > < br > “ i ’ m too short-wind to make a good sleuth-hound , cap ’ n mike , and it < br > ain ’ t dignifi for a man of

the man never show hisself in ’ ere befor , ” said she . “ you ’ re more < br > like to find out about ’ im at the docks. ” < br > < br > “ say , cap ’ n mike , ” exclaim johnni kent with pucker brow

, refin face with the snowi < br > mustach and imperi , o ’ shea gleefulli shout : < br > < br > “ the king , god bless him ! so thi bright young minist of financ wa < br > a liar as well as a thief ! ” < br > < br > comic abash , johnni kent mumbl an apolog for make such an < br > uproar , at which the elderli gentleman bow acknowledg and said to < br > the perturb and rumpl strother : < br > < br

, ” said the < br > other , “ and i hail from the state o ’ main . and we can show you our < br > paper . _we_ didn ’ t lose ’ em in the bay of biscay. ” < br > < br > strother stood bite hi nail and shift from one foot to the < br > other , for onc strip of hi adroit , plausibl demeanor , nor could < br > he find , on the spur of the moment , the right word to say . the royal < br > personag said it for him . < br > < br > “ i think you had better retir . i wish to hear what captain o ’ shea and < br > mr. kent may have to tell me. ” < br > < br > the amiabl monarch wa unconsci sway by the viril person < br > of captain o ’ shea , who domin the scene as though he were on the < br > deck of hi own ship . < br > < br > baron frederick martin strother made a last attempt to protest , but <

etiquett of court troubl o ’ shea not in the least as he < br > cheerili yet respect suggest to the perplex elderli gentleman : < br > < br > “ now , king osmond , if you will pleas sit down and let us talk thing < br > over with ye as man to man , we ’ ll tell you how it happened. ” < br > < br > the personag obedi did as he wa told , nor could he feel offend < br > by the shipmast ’ s boyish

whi he had permit thi brace of total stranger to take < br > him by storm . o ’ shea broke into hi cogit by explain : < br > < br > “ you are surpris that ye chuck the trust minist of financ out < br

up to rob ye. ” < br > < br > “ we saw you in the jolli mermaid tavern , and we like your look , ” < br > ingenu ad johnni kent . “ we decid to do you a good turn , < br > whether we ever saw the color of your money or not. ” < br > < br > “ and we didn ’ t like the cut of the jib of your minist of financ , ” < br > resum o ’ shea . “ and we were dead sure that captain handi wa rotten. ” < br

> < br > “ the two of them are tar with the same brush , ” exclaim o ’ shea . < br > “ they fix it up between them to pay twenty-four thousand pound for < br > the _tyneshir glen_ and sell her to you for thirti thousand . ’ ti a < br > simpl matter to produc the evid . send a messeng to tavistock & < br > huntley in leadenhal street . they name the price to captain handi and < br > your preciou minist of financ . ’ ti a clear case. ” < br > < br > “ you can buy her yourself from georg huntley , and he ’ ll be darn glad < br > to get hi price , ” chime in johnni kent . “ that ought to prove it . but < br > if you ’ ll listen to me , you ’ ll have nothin ’ to do with the _tyneshir < br > glen_. ” < br > < br > king osmond ’ s faith in human natur had been sever jar , but < br > somehow he could not doubt the statement of these rug men who drove < br > their word home as with a sledge-hamm . toward the graceless minist < br > of financ he felt more sorrow than anger as he wove togeth in hi < br > mind thi and that circumst of previou transact which should < br > have made him more vigil . but the culprit wa the son of a dear < br > friend , and hi credenti had been impecc . < br > < br > “ i shall obtain from tavistock & huntley confirm of your stori , as < br > you suggest , ” he slowli repli to o ’ shea . “ in the meantim i wish you < br > would tell me about yourselves. ” < br

voyag to hayti and hondura and < br > cuba without the consent of the law govern , and we know our < br > trade. ” < br > < br > king osmond i reflect stroke hi white imperi , and hi face < br > assum an express of vivid interest . these men were differ from < br > captain handi . they would neither cring nor lie to him , and they < br > look him squar between the eye . < br > < br > “ will you be good enough to come into my own room ? ” said he . “ we shall < br > find more privaci and comfort . i should like to hear of your adventur < br > along the spanish main. ” < br > < br > with a courteou gestur he show them into a much larger and more < br > luxuri room which wa use as a librari or privat offic , inasmuch < br > as a larg flat-top desk wa strewn with book , pamphlet , and < br > document , and more of them were pile on tabl and on shelv against < br > the wall . as temporari headquart for royalti at work , the room < br > suggest industri and the administr of larg affair . < br > < br > so friendli and unconvent wa the recept grant them that < br > captain o ’ shea and johnni kent were made to feel that their intrus < br > demand no more apolog . their curios fairli torment them . it < br > wa on the tip of their tongu to ask the host what kind of a kingdom < br > wa hi , and where it wa situat , but thi would be rude . o ’ shea < br > took note of sever admiralti chart on the desk , two of them unrol < br > with the corner pin down , and a rule and divid for measur < br > distanc . < br > < br > while o ’ shea talk , johnni kent let hi eye wander to a small tabl < br > at hi elbow . it wa cover with magazin , govern report , and < br > newspap clip . one of the latter wa so place that he wa abl < br > to read it from where he sat , and with absorb interest he perus the < br > follow paragraph : < br > < br > colonel osmond georg sydenham-leach , of the ancient norfolk < br > famili , ha live on the contin for the last dozen year , and < br > is better known to the boulevard of pari than to london . he wa < br > never consid eccentr until recent when hi claim to the < br > island of trinadaro in the south atlant as a sovereign realm <

trinadaro have been bestow < br > upon the fortun gentlemen compos hi cabinet and coteri of < br > advis . a court circular is expect to appear shortli , and a < br > diplomat servic will be organ . <

lest hi wealth may be squander on thi curious mediæv < br > concept of set up an independ princip upon an < br > unproduct , volcan island in mid-ocean which no nation ha < br > taken the troubl to annex . < br > < br > slowli and care johnni kent possess himself of thi inform < br > with never a flicker of a smile . the solut of the mysteri of king < br > osmond i impress him as neither grotesqu nor curious mediæv . < br > in all london the king of trinadaro could not have found two men of < br > readier mind to fall in with hi project and pretens . to play at < br > be a king on a desert island , to have the mean to make it all come < br > true -- whi , thought johnni kent , and he knew o ’ shea must instantli agre < br > with him , ani man worth hi salt would jump at the chanc . < br > < br > he wa anxiou to pass the tide on to hi comrad , and when the < br > convers slacken he edg in : < br > < br > “ we must be on our way , cap ’ n mike . hi majesti is good-heart to < br

cordial declar < br > that he must see them again , and made an appoint for ten o ’ clock of < br > the next forenoon . they took their departur after friendli farewel < br > and steer a cours for blackwal and the tavern of the jolli mermaid . < br > < br > o ’ shea wa as delight as a boy to learn that osmond i wa about to < br > found an island kingdom . it wa a more attract revel than < br > if he had been discov to be the inconsequenti ruler of some < br > effet littl domain of europ . and if one plan to set himself < br > up in busi as a sovereign , it wa proper to use all the pomp and < br > trap and ceremoni that belong to the game . < br > < br > “ if he is to have a navi , ” cri o ’ shea as he pound hi friend on the < br > back , “ i know where he can find an admir and a fleet engineer. ” < br > < br > “ not so fast , cap ’ n mike . i have a notion that he ’ ll have hi own < br > troubl gettin ’ to hi kingdom . ani man that can be bunco as easi as < br > he wa is liabl to have all hi playth taken away from him befor < br > he ha a chanc to use ’ em . i ’ ll feel safer about him when he get < br > clear of london river. ” < br > < br > befor seek the royal audienc next morn they went to leadenhal < br > street to see georg huntley . the ship-brok greet them indignantli . < br > < br > “ you would tri to hoodwink me , would you ? ” exclaim he . “ i have found < br > out who your mysteri king is . i receiv a letter from him last < br > night , ask inform about the price of the _tyneshir glen_ . i < br > had no idea it wa thi crazi colonel sydenham-leach that call himself < br > ruler of trinadaro. ” < br > < br > “ own up like a man , georg , ” shout o ’ shea . “ ye would like noth < br > better than to be thi kind of a king yourself. ” < br > < br > “ you have read my thought like a wizard . but , confound you , you have < br > spoil the sale of a steamer for me . how about that ? ” < br > < br > “ we have tri to keep an estim king from go to davi jone ’ s < br > locker in a float coffin that ye call the _tyneshir glen_ , ” < br > sever retort o ’ shea . “ have ye ani steamer that will pass honest < br > men ’ s inspect ? ” < br > < br > “ plenti of them , ” promptli answer huntley . < br > < br > “ then we will look at two or three of them to-day , after we have paid < br > our respect to hi majesti . we will not let him be cheat out of hi < br

br > confid : < br > < br > “ i don ’ t know , i ’ m sure , whether you chap are joke or not . howev , < br > here is a bit of news for you on the quiet . i met a friend of mine , < br > a barrist , yesterday . we had luncheon at the cheshir chees and < br > someth or other set him to talk about thi sydenham-leach affair . < br > it seem that the lawyer are quit keen about it . the famili relat <

thrown away in < br > thi mad enterpris , as they call it. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea wa righteous wrath as he flung out : < br > < br > “ would they interfer with a gentleman and hi divers ? hasn ’ t he a < br > right to spend hi money as he pleas ? have ye ever seen him , georg ? < br > he is a grand man to meet , and ’ ti proud we are to be hi friends. ” < br > < br > “ oh , i imagin they will have a job to prove he is insan , ” said < br > huntley . “ but they may make a pot of troubl for him. ” < br > < br > “ i suppos they can pester him with all kind of legal foolish and < br > haul him befor the court , and so on , ” agre o ’ shea . “ it would break < br > hi heart and spoil all hi fun . ’ ti an outrag shame , georg . what < br > is the system in thi countri when they want to investig a man ’ s top < br > stori ? ” < br > < br > “ i ask the barrist chap , ” repli huntley . “ the friend of the < br > person suspect of be dotti , usual hi near rel , lay the < br > case befor one of the judg in lunaci , and he order an inquiri , < br > which is held befor a master in lunaci . then if the alleg lunat < br > demand a trial by juri he get it . if he can ’ t convinc them that he < br > is sound in the thinker , hi estat is put in charg of a committe < br > duli appoint by law. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea listen glumli and glower hi intens displeasur . if the law < br > could interfer with a man who wish to be king of an island which < br > nobodi els want , then the law wa all wrong . < br > < br > “ and these indec rel who want hi money will wait and spring < br > a surpris on him , ” said the aggriev shipmast . “ they will take hi < br > ship away from him and knock all hi beauti scheme into a cock < br > hat. ” < br > < br > “ i imagin he would not be allow to

mike . you come along with us , georg huntley . we ’ re on our way to have < br > a confab with hi majesti , and mayb you can do some busi with him < br > right off the reel . he ought to load hi ship and head for blue water < br > as quick as the lord will let him. ” < br > < br > < br > ii < br > < br > behold , then , the pair of exil yanke marin stanchli enlist on < br > the side of king osmond i of trinadaro , against the design of all who < br > would thwart hi gorgeou and impractic purpos . that hi rank and < br > titl were self-assum and hi realm as yet unpeopl impress these < br > ingenu sailormen as neither shadowi nor absurd . < br > < br > king osmond i wa an elderli gentleman of a singularli guileless < br > disposit , and the notorieti attend hi uniqu project had < br > caus him to be surround by person who knew precis what they < br > want . of these the vanish minist of financ , baron frederick < br > martin strother , of the brisk demeanor and the red waistcoat , had < br > been a conspicu exampl . it wa a rare piec of good fortun for < br > the amiabl monarch that there should have come to hi aid two such < br > hard-head and honest adventur as o ’ shea and johnni kent . < br > < br > as the result of sever interview they were engag to select a < br > steamer and to take charg of her for the voyag to trinadaro . their < br > qualif were warmli indors by the well-known ship-brok firm < br > of tavistock & huntley , of leadenhal street . the manag partner , < br > that solid man with the romant tempera , took the keenest interest < br > in everi detail of the picturesqu enterpris . it would have been a < br > temptat not easi to resist if king osmond had offer him the place < br > of minist of marin , with the bestow of the insignia of the grand <

king plan to carri with him a sort of < br > vanguard of subject , or colonist , who were to erect build , set up < br > machineri , till the soil , prospect for miner wealth , and otherwis < br > lay the foundat of empir . these pioneer were larg recruit < br > from hi own estat and villag in norfolk , and form a sturdi < br > compani of british yeomanri . < br > < br > captain michael o ’ shea wa never one to smother hi opinion from < br > motiv of flatteri or self-interest , and what inform about < br > trinadaro he had been abl to pick up on hi own account wa not dy < br > in glow color . < br > < br > “ i have not seen the island meself , your majesti , ” said he , “ but the < br > sail direct set it down as mostli tall rock with a difficult < br > landing-plac and a dens popul of hungri land-crab as big < br > as your hat . and if it wa ani good , would not some one of these < br > benevol power have gobbl it up long ago ? ” < br > < br > king osmond pleasantli made answer to such object . < br > < br > “ sever year ago i made a long voyag in a sailing-ship on account of < br > my health , captain o ’ shea , and we touch at trinadaro to get turtl < br > and fresh water . it wa then that i conceiv the idea of take < br > possess of the island as an independ princip . although it < br > ha a most forbid aspect from seaward , there is an inland plateau < br > fit for

whimsic smile , “ that avail domain are so scarc that one should < br > not be too particular . trinadaro appear to have been overlooked. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti a rule that the christian nation will steal ani territori that < br > is not nail down , ” wa the dubiou comment of o ’ shea . “ they must have < br > a poor opinion of trinadaro , but , as ye say , ’ ti about the onli chanc < br > that is left for a king to work at hi trade with a brand-new sign over < br > the door. ” < br > < br > johnni kent spent most hi time down river among the london dock . < br > wherev sea-go steamer were for sale or charter hi bulki figur < br > might have been seen trudg from deck to engine-room . < br > < br > at length , with the royal approv , o ’ shea had the purchas paper made < br > out for the fine steamer _tarlington_ , which wa berth in a basin < br > of the east india dock . she wa a modern , well-equip freighter of < br > four thousand ton which had been in the australian trade and could < br > be fit for sea at a few day ’ notic . the transfer of ownership < br > wa given no needless public . georg huntley attend to that . he < br > had anoth interview with hi friend , the barrist , who hint at < br > forthcom event which grave threaten the peac and welfar of < br > osmond i and the kingdom of trinadaro . < br > < br > o ’ shea and johnni kent discuss thi latest inform at supper in < br > the jolli mermaid tavern with a platter of fri sole between them . < br > < br > “ ’ ti thi way , ” explain o ’ shea . “ there is no doubt at all that thi < br > grand king of our will figur in the lunaci proceed that we heard < br > wa in the wind . hi rel are get greedier and more worri < br > everi day . and until the matter is decid one way or anoth they will < br > use everi mean the law allow to head him off from spend the good < br > money that belong to him. ” < br > < br > “ and how can they stop him from scatterin ’ hi coin for these wise and < br > benevol purpos of hi ? ” demand the engin . < br > < br > “ well , georg huntley say the law will permit them to clap some kind < br > of a restrainin ’ order on the ship and hold her in the dock with the <

br > “ but all thi infern shindi can ’ t be start unless there ’ s proof < br > posit that hi majesti intend to fli the coop , cap ’ n mike. ” < br > < br > “ right you are , johnni , you old sea-lawy . they can ’ t bother the king < br > until he is actual on board and the ship is clear , so the barrist < br > lad tell george. ” < br > < br > “ then they ’ ll be watchin ’ the _tarlington_ like terrier at a < br > rat-hol , ” exclaim the engin . < br > < br > “ no , they won ’ t , ” cri o ’ shea with tremend earnest . “ do ye mind < br > how we slip out of charleston harbor in the _hercules_ steamer , < br > bound on the filibusterin ’ expedit to hondura ? ’ twa a success < br > stratagem , and it could be done in london river. ” < br > < br > “ sure it could , ” and johnni kent chuckl joyous . “ and the king < br > needn ’ t know anyth about it. ” < br > < br > “ of cours we will keep it from him if we can , ” agre o ’ shea . “ i will < br > do anyth short of murder to keep him happi and undisturb . and < br > it would upset him terribl to know that he must be smuggl out of < br > england to dodg the rascal that would keep him at home as a suspect < br > lunatic. ” < br > < br > “ we ’ d better put georg huntley next to thi proposit of our , ” < br > suggest johnni . “ he itch to be a red-hand conspirator. ” < br > < br > the ship-brok admir the scheme when it wa explain to him . ye , < br > the old _tyneshir glen_ which they had so scorn declin to < br > purchas wa still at her moor , and they were welcom to use her < br > as a dummi , or decoy , or whatev one might choos to call it . o ’ shea < br > could pretend to load her , he could send as mani peopl on board as < br > he like , and put a gang of mechan at work all over the balli old < br > hooker , said huntley . if the enemi of king osmond i took it for < br > grant that the _tyneshir glen_ wa the ship select to carri him < br > off to trinadaro , that wa their own lookout . it wa a regular yanke < br > trick , by jove ! < br > < br > o ’ shea and johnni kent took great care to avoid be seen in the < br > vicin of the _tarlington_ . such inspect and supervis as were < br > necessari they contriv to attend to after dark . the king wa up to < br > hi ear in urgent busi and wa easili persuad to leav the whole < br > conduct of the ship ’ s affair in their capabl hand and to waiv < br > preliminari visit to the east india dock . < br > < br > o ’ shea employ a scotch engin , who understood that hi wage < br > depend on hi taciturn , to overse such repair work as the < br > _tarlington_ need , and to keep steam in the donkey-boil . < br > < br > all sign indic that the _tarlington_ wa prepar for one of her < br > customari voyag to australia . soon the cargo began to stream into her < br > hatch . the ostens destin of the truck-load of case and < br > crate and bale of merchandis were sydney , melbourn , wellington , < br > fremantl , and so on . one might read the name of the consigne neatli < br > stencil on everi packag . thi wa done under the eye of captain < br > o ’ shea , who , in hi time , had load hundr of box of rifl and < br > cartridg innoc label “ condens milk , ” “ prime virginia ham , ” < br > and “ farm tools. ” < br > < br > but the place to find roar , ostentati activ wa on board the < br > old _tyneshir glen_ . thi rusti steamer fairli hum . captain o ’ shea < br > visit her daili , and johnni kent hustl an engine-room crew with < br > loud and bitter word . it appear as though the ship must be in a < br > great hurri to go to sea . while they were stir up as much pretend < br > industri as possibl , the question of a cargo wa not overlook . it < br > wa shove on board as fast as the longshoremen in the hold could < br > handl it . nor did these brawni toiler know that all these stout < br > wooden box so plainli mark and consign to trinadaro “ via s.s. < br > _tyneshir glen_ ” contain onli brick , sand , stone , and scrap-iron . < br > < br > they were part of the theatric properti of captain o ’ shea , who < br > could readili produc a make-believ cargo for a fake voyag in a < br > steamer which had no intent of leav port . < br > < br > the london newspap show renew interest in the scheme and dream < br > of king osmond i of trinadaro . the _tyneshir glen_ wa visit by < br > inquisit journalist with note-book and camera . captain o ’ shea < br > welcom them right courteous , and gave them inform , cigar , < br > and excel whiskey . they return to their sever offic to write < br > breezi column about the prepar for the singular voyag of the < br > _tyneshir glen_ . so sever are the english libel law that never a < br > hint wa print of the possibl legal obstacl which might bring the < br > enterpris to naught . for purpos of public , king osmond i wa as < br > sane as a trivet unless a judg and juri should offici declar him < br > otherwis . < br > < br > nevertheless , the intim had reach the newspap offic that < br > the rel of colonel sydenham-leach were like to take step to < br > prevent him from leav england . and report were assign to watch < br > the _tyneshir glen_ up to the veri moment of departur . < br > < br > now and then johnni kent quietli trundl himself on board the < br > _tarlington_ , usual after nightfal , and wa gratifi to find that < br > progress wa run smoothli in all depart . so nearli readi for < br > sea wa the big cargo-boat that the time had come to devis the final < br > detail of the stratagem . < br > < br > accordingli , captain o ’ shea went boldli to the custom hous , and took < br > out clearanc paper not for the _tarlington_ to australia , but for the < br > _tyneshir glen_ to the island of trinadaro . the chief offic whom he < br > had select to sail with him held a master ’ s certif and the ship < br > wa clear in hi name . < br > < br > as for the _tarlington_ , which wa realli to sail while the _tyneshir < br > glen_ remain peac at her moor in the east india dock , < br > o ’ shea decid to omit the formal of clearanc . as he explain to < br > johnni kent : < br > < br > “ the less attent call to the _tarlington_ the better . onc at sea < br > we will hoist the flag of trinadaro over our ship , and hi majesti ’ s < br > govern will give her a registri and us our certif . ’ ti handi < br > to be an independ sovereign with a merchant marin of hi own. ” < br > < br > the servic of an employ agenc enabl o ’ shea to muster < br > sever score bogu colonist or subject of king osmond , person of < br > respect appear who were glad to earn ten shill apiec by < br > march on board the _tyneshir glen_ with bag and bundl in their < br > hand . there could be no room for doubt in the public mind that the < br > eccentr , grandios colonel sydenham-leach wa on the point of leav < br > hi nativ shore with hi peopl and materi to found hi island < br > princip . < br > < br > it seem advis to captain o ’ shea to take the _tarlington_ out < br > of the dock late in the afternoon , swing into the river , and anchor < br > until king osmond should be brought aboard in a tug furnish by georg < br > huntley . there wa much less risk of observ in have the royal < br > passeng join the ship after nightfal and away from the popul < br > dock , in addit to which o ’ shea prefer to get clear of the < br > cramp stone basin and gate and hold hi ship in the fair-way with < br > room for a speedi departur in the event of a stern chase . < br > < br > he artlessli explain that thi arrang would allow the king to < br > spend sever more hour ashor in wind up the final detail of hi < br > busi . the unsuspect osmond i approv these plan and had no < br > idea that they were part of an elabor conspiraci to smuggl him out < br > of england under cover of dark . < br > < br > as a crafti devic to throw the enemi off the scent , o ’ shea conceiv < br > what he view as a master-strok . georg huntley wa call into < br > consult and promptli sent for a superannu clerk of hi offic < br > staff who had been pension after mani year of faith servic . he < br > prove to be a slender , white-hair man who carri himself with a < br > great deal of digniti , and at the first glimps of him o ’ shea exclaim < br > delightedli : < br > < br > “ you couldn ’ t have done better , georg , if you had rake london with a < br > comb . put a snowi mustach and chin whisker on him and he will pass for < br > king osmond of trinadaro with no troubl at all. ” < br > < br > “ i think we can turn him into a pretti fair counterfeit , ” grin < br > huntley . “ and when he walk aboard the _tyneshir glen_ at dusk and < br > all those bogu subject at ten shill each rais a loyal cheer , < br > the hoax will be complet . thi is the artist touch to make the job < br > perfect. ” < br > < br > “ and what am i to do after that , mr. huntley , if you pleas ? ” timidli < br > inquir the elderli clerk . “ if it ’ s onli a practic joke , i don ’ t < br > mind -- -- ” < br > < br > “ play the part , thompson . acknowledg the homag of the ship ’ s compani < br > and go below at onc . dodg into a state-room . the ship will probabl < br > be watch by person keenli interest in your movement . if they poke < br > a mess of legal document at you , accept them without argument . the < br > meddlesom gent will leav you alon after that . they will mere < br > keep close watch of the ship to make sure that you don ’ t run away with < br > her . when you come back to london in the morn , pluck off the fals < br > whisker , and be handsom reward for your exert . i ’ ll see that < br > you get in no trouble. ” < br > < br > “ it is a bit queer , mr. huntley , but you were alway a great hand for a < br > lark , ” said the clerk . “ thank you , i will do as you say. ” < br > < br > the genuin colonist of king osmond stole on board the _tarlington_ , < br > singli , and by two and three , some befor she pull out of the < br > dock , other by boat after she swung into the stream . at the same time < br > the imit voyag from the employ agenc were make as much < br > nois and bustl as possibl as they troop on board the _tyneshir < br > glen_ . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea intend to convey the king from the hotel to the < br > _tarlington_ , but at the last moment he wa detain to quell a ruction < br > in the forecastl . georg huntley had been unexpectedli summon to the < br > hotel cecil to see an american millionair who wa in a great hurri < br > to charter a yacht . o ’ shea therefor sent a messag to hi majesti < br > direct him to have hi carriag driven to a certain land on the < br > river-front of the east india dock , where he would be met by the chief < br > offic of the _tarlington_ and escort aboard the ship . < br > < br > within the same hour , the dignifi , elderli clerk by the name of < br > thompson might have been seen to enter a carriag close by the hotel < br > carleton , and those stand near heard him tell the driver to go to < br > the steamer _tyneshir glen_ . < br > < br > the chief offic of the _tarlington_ , wait near an electr light < br > at the landing-pi , abreast of which the steamer wa anchor in the < br > stream , felt a weight of respons for the safe deliveri of king < br > osmond , and wa easier in mind when he saw a carriag halt within a few < br > yard of him . the window frame the kindli featur , the white mustach < br > and imperi , which the chief offic instantli identifi . hasten < br > to assist hi majesti from the carriag , he announc apologet : < br > < br > “ captain o ’ shea send hi compliment and regret that he is detain < br > on board . the ship is readi as soon as you are. ” < br > < br > the king murmur a word or two of thank . the chief offic care < br > assist him to board the tug , which speedili move away from the pier < br > and turn to run alongsid the _tarlington_ . the import passeng < br > mount the steamer ’ s gangway and stood upon the shadowi deck , whose < br > row of light had been purpos turn off lest hi figur might be < br > discern from shore . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea wa wait to get the ship under way . it wa no time < br > for ceremoni . the busi of the moment wa to head for the open sea , < br > and beyond the reach of the british law and it offic . a few minut < br > later , captain o ’ shea hasten aft to greet hi majesti and explain hi < br > failur to welcom him on board . meet the chief offic , he halt < br > to ask : < br > < br > “ everyth all right , mr. arbuthnot ? did he ask for me ? did he give < br > you ani order ? ” < br > < br > “ all satisfactori , sir . the king said he wa veri tire and would go to < br > hi room at once. ” < br > < br > “ i wonder should i disturb him ? ” said o ’ shea to himself , hesit . < br > “ ’ ti not etiquett to break into hi rest . well , i will go back to the < br > bridg and wait a bit . mayb he will be send for me . my place is < br > with the pilot till the ship ha poke her way past gravesend and is < br > clear of thi muck of up-riv shipping. ” < br > < br > the _tarlington_ found a less crowd reach of the thame as she pass < br

aros from the < br > saloon deck . the commot wa so startl that o ’ shea bound down < br > from the bridg and wa confront by a smooth-shaven , slender , elderli < br > man who flourish a fals mustach and imperi in hi fist as he < br > indignantli cri : < br > < br > “ i say , thi is all wrong as sure as my name is thompson . i never < br > bargain with mr. georg huntley to be kidnap and taken to sea . i < br > don ’ t want to go , i tell you . these peopl tell me that thi steamer is < br > bound to some island or other thousand of mile from here . i stand on < br > my right as an englishman . i demand that i be taken back to london at < br > once. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea glare stupidli at the irat clerk so long in the employ of < br > tavistock & huntley . for onc the resourc shipmast wa utterli < br > taken aback . he manag to say in a sort of quaver stage whisper : < br > < br > “ for the love of heaven , what ha becom of the real king ? who mislaid < br > him ? where is he now ? ” < br > < br > “ i don ’ t know and i ’ m sure i don ’ t care , ” bitterli return the < br > affright thompson . “ i wa an ass to consent to thi make-believ job. ” < br > < br > “ but how did you two

wa the genuin king , wasn ’ t < br > i ? so i play the part as well as i could. ” < br > < br > “ ye play it right up to the hilt . my chief offic will vouch for < br > that , ” and o ’ shea held hi head between hi hand . he sent for johnni < br > kent and briefli announc : < br > < br > “ we are shi one king , johnni . the deal ha been switch on us somehow . < br > our boss wa left behind. ” <

< br > “ the real king went in the discard , johnni . we ’ ve fetch the dummi to < br > sea . the one that came aboard wa the other one. ” < br > < br > “ then what in blaze becam of our belov king

br > “ it ain ’ t reason for us to keep on our cours for trinadaro without < br > the boss , ” suggest the chief engin . “ thi is hi ship and cargo. ” < br > < br > thi wa so self-evid that captain o ’ shea answer never a word , < br > but gave order to let go an anchor and hold the ship in the river < br > until further notic . then he turn to glower at an excit group of < br > passeng who had muster at the foot of the bridg ladder and were < br > loudli demand that he come down and talk to them . they were loyal < br > subject of the vanish monarch , hi secretari , artisan , foremen , < br

o ’ shea gave them hi word that he would not proceed to sea without < br > the miss sovereign , and dure a brief lull in the excit he < br > thrust the bewild thompson , the masquerad , into the chart-room < br > and pelt him with question . the latter wa posit that he had < br > direct the cabman to drive to the _tyneshir glen_ . and the fellow < br > wa particular to stop and ask hi way when just insid the entranc < br > to the dock . at least , he had halt hi cab to talk to some one who < br > wa appar give him inform . thompson wa unabl to overhear < br > the convers . < br > < br

, ” cri < br > captain o ’ shea as he fled from the chart-room . johnni kent had made < br > anoth journey from the lower region to seek enlighten . o ’ shea < br > thump him between the shoulder and

the dock by now and a < br > tug wait to transfer him . in the dark the shadowi outlin of one < br > steamer look veri like anoth , and king osmond thought that perhap < br > the plan of sail might have been chang at the last moment . < br > < br > the cabman strenuous assur him that thi wa the _tarlington_ , and < br > he decid that he had better go aboard and look for captain o ’ shea . < br > if a mistak had been made , it should be an easi matter to find the < br > landing-pi and the wait tug . < br > < br > no sooner had the king reach the deck than he wa convinc that he < br > had been direct to the wrong steamer . the peopl who stare at him < br > were utter stranger . there wa not a subject of trinadaro among them , < br > nor did ani of the offic of the ship step forward to greet him . he < br > wa about to accost the nearest spectat when an offici man dress < br > in seedi black confront him , flourish a formidable-appear < br > document under the royal nose , and pompous affirm : < br > < br > “ a writ from the judg duli appoint and author by the lord < br > chancellor to take cogniz of such case , distrain colonel osmond < br > georg sydenham-leach from attempt to

the most < br > sapient monarch that ever wield sceptr . as a land proprietor , < br > a retir offic of the militia , a conserv in polit , king < br > osmond had profound respect for the law and the constitut of hi < br > nativ land . he wa not one to defi a judici writ or to grappl with < br > the situat in a high-hand manner . in other word , he wa rather < br > colonel sydenham-leach in thi

“ on thi ship ? ” exclaim johnni kent . “ how ridicul ! what ’ ll we do < br > with thi pair of bailiff , or whatev you call ’ em , cap ’ n mike ? make < br > ’ em eat their document ? ” < br > < br > “ no ; we will take the two meddler along with us , ” sweetli answer < br > o ’ shea . “ we can ’ t afford to leav them behind to tell how it happened. ” < br > < br > “ but they have all the power and author of the british govern < br > behind them , ” spoke up king osmond . < br > < br > “ and they have a long voyag ahead of them , ” said o ’ shea . “ your majesti < br > can give them job in your own judici depart and they will grow < br > up with the country. ” < br > < br > “ i can not counten such action , ” began the king , but johnni kent < br > interrupt to remark with much vehem : < br > < br > “ excus us , your majesti , but thi ain ’ t no time for argument about < br > the british constitut . cap ’ n mike and me agre to take you and < br > your ship to trinadaro . it wa a

by the help hand of johnni kent . the seamen < br > shove off and o ’ shea steer for the long black hull of the steamer < br > visibl a few hundr yard down-stream . unabl to voic hi confus < br > emot

“ that make me feel a bit more cheer , ” said o ’ shea to himself . < br > “ mayb he ha decid to forgiv us . we were guilti of high treason , < br > disobedi , and a few other thing , in pack him off

king osmond had left word that he wa to be call whenev the first < br > glimps of hi island should be reveal . but he came not to the bridg < br > in respons to the messag from captain o ’ shea . in

he will be the king there till the judgment day. ” < br > < br > the _tarlington_ slowli approach the precipit coast-lin and < br > chang her cours to pass around to the lee of the island . as the <

, < br > after you sail from london , that it might need trinadaro as a < br > landing-bas for a new cabl between south america and africa , and < br > sent us to hoist the flag over the place . brazil heard of the affair < br > and sent a ship to set up a claim on the basi of an earli discoveri . < br > the portugues have present their evid , i believ , becaus their < br > peopl made some

, “ what wa the opinion at home about thi king of < br > trinadaro ? he wa a bit mad , i take it. ” < br > < br > “ no more than you or me , ” answer o ’ shea . “ he had a beauti dream , < br > and it made him veri happi , but it wa not hi fate to see it come < br > true . and no doubt it is better that he did not live to know that the < br > scheme wa ruin . hi island ha been taken away from him . it will be < br > wrangl over by england and brazil and the rest of them , and there < br > is no room for a king that hope to enjoy himself in hi own way . the < br > world ha no place for a man like colonel osmond georg sydenham-leach , < br > my dear sir. ” < br > < br > “ too bad ! ” sigh the lieuten . “ and what are your plan , captain < br > o ’ shea ? do you intend to make ani formal claim in behalf of the late < br > king ? ” < br > < br > “ no . hi dream die with him . there is no heir to the throne . i ’ m < br > thank that hi finish wa so bright and hope . there will be < br > funer

_tarlington_ , captain o ’ shea and < br > johnni kent went into the chart-room and talk togeth for some time . < br > at length the simple-heart chief engin said with a wist smile : < br > < br > “ i

fifteen year ago the crack atlant liner were no larger than ten < br > thousand ton . some of them are still in servic , safe and comfort < br > ship , quit fast enough for the travel who is not

> where he wa minist to by hi physician , hi secretari , and hi < br > valet . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea and johnni kent enjoy the luxuri of such a voyag < br > as thi . there wa no respons to burden them on the bridg or < br > in the engine-room . no one guess that they were uncommonli capabl < br > marin , accustom to command . professor ernst wilhelm vonderholtz < br > seem to find their compani congeni , and tri to make them talk < br > about themselv . hi curios wa polit dissembl , but o ’ shea < br > took note of it and built up an elabor fiction to the effect that < br > he wa a pavement contractor in new york with friend at tammani hall , < br > while johnni kent found genuin satisfact in pose as a retir < br > farmer from the state of main . it occur to o ’ shea to remark to hi < br > comrad as they were undress in their room on the second night at < br > sea : < br > < br > “ the chemic professor suspect we are not what we seem . and he is < br > anxiou to fathom us. ” < br > < br > “ oh , pooh ! he ’ s one of them high and lofti thinker that wouldn ’ t < br > bother hi head about ignor , every-day cuss like us , ” sleepili < br > repli johnni kent as he kick off hi shoe . < br > < br > “ you fool yourself , ” and o ’ shea spoke with decis . “ he is full of < br > big word and thing that i do not pretend to understand at all , but < br > he is not wrap up in them entir , like most of the professor and < br > such . there is a pair of keen eye behind those gold-rim spectacl < br > of hi , johnni , and he is not miss anyth that goe on. ” < br > < br > “ i take notic that he ain ’ t overlookin ’ that handsom school-teach < br > that ’ s been studyin ’ abroad for a year . hi eye are sharp enough to < br > sight her whenev she come on deck . and she ain ’ t hostil to him , < br > either. ” < br > < br > “ i grant ye that , you sentiment old pirat , ” said o ’ shea , “ but i am < br > not a match-mak , and ’ ti no concern of mine . what i am wonder is < br > whether the man is realli a univers professor bent on ‘ investig < br > the scientif educ of the unit states. ’ ” < br > < br > “ you ’ re welcom to sit up and hatch mysteri by yourself , ” grumbl < br > the other . “ i want to go to sleep . what ’ s the clew to all thi , cap ’ n < br > mike ? what make you so darn suspici ? ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti no more than a hunch , johnni . i ’ m irish , and my peopl feel < br > thing in the air . we don ’ t have to be told . thi professor ernst < br > wilhelm vonderholtz doe not ring true . there is a flaw in him < br > somewhere. ” < br > < br > “ well , we ’ re sort of travel in disguis ourselv , ain ’ t we , cap ’ n < br > mike ? i feel plumb full of fals pretenc . the pot call the kettl < br > black . how about that ? ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti our own busi , ” snap o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ so is hi , ” briefli conclud johnni kent as he crawl into the < br > bunk . no more than five minut later he wa snore with the rhythm < br > and volum of a whistl buoy in a swing sea . o ’ shea lay awak for < br > some time , tri to fit hi uneasi surmis togeth , or to toss them < br > asid as so much rubbish . he had not heard the banshe cri , but a vagu < br > conjectur had fasten itself in hi mind that someth wa fate to < br > go wrong with thi voyag of the _alsatian_ . and without tangibl caus < br > or reason , he found thi forebod interwoven with the presenc on < br > board of the affabl , mild-mann , studiou professor ernst wilhelm < br > vonderholtz . < br > < br > sailormen are notabl superstiti , and o ’ shea had been school to < br > bewar of cross-ey finn in the forecastl and black cat in the < br > cabin . but sure no tradit of the sea held it an ill omen to have < br > on board a blond scientist with gold-rim spectacl and a well-cut < br > beard who wa seek inform among the technic school and < br > univers of the unit state . < br > < br > “ he ha it in hi head that johnni kent and i are seafarin ’ men by < br > trade , and he want to make sure of it for some reason of hi own , ” < br > reflect o ’ shea . “ it ha strain me imagin to lie to him and < br > get away with it . as for johnni , he would rather talk farm than < br > anyth els in the world , so he will pass for a genuin hayse in < br > ani company. ” < br > < br > they were depriv of the pleasant societi of professor vonderholtz < br > next day , for he boldli monopol the school-teach , miss jen , < br > who seem not in the least bore by hi assidu attent . elderli < br > ladi watch them with open interest , and diagnos it as one of < br > those swift and absorb steamship romanc . < br > < br > for three day out of liverpool the _alsatian_ move unev over < br > the face of the water . the weather wa bright , the sea smooth . the < br > scratch crew of firemen toil faith in the torrid cavern far < br > below , and the mighti engin throb unceasingli to whirl the twin < br > screw that push the foam mile astern . on the bridg the captain < br > and hi offic went cheer about their task , thank for clear < br > sky and a good day ’ s run . < br > < br > it wa after midnight , and the _alsatian_ wa in mid-ocean , when a few < br > of the first-cabin passeng heard what sound to their drowsi ear < br > like sever pistol shot . there are mani nois aboard a steamship < br > that are unfamiliar to the landsman . except captain o ’ shea and < br > johnni kent , such of the passeng as had been awaken paid so littl < br > heed to the sound that they soon went to sleep again . < br > < br > the two seafar slumber lightli , as is the habit of men use to < br > turn out to stand watch . and they were not like to mistak the < br > report of a revolv for ani sound to be expect in the routin of < br > thing on shipboard . o ’ shea lean over from the upper berth and ask < br > in low tone : < br > < br > “ are ye awak , johnni ? ” < br > < br > “ sure i am . did you hear the rumpu ? ” < br > < br > “ ye . at first i thought i wa dream we were aboard the old < br > _fearless_ with jiminez , the big black nigger from venezuela , take < br > pot shot at me . what did ye make of it ? it sound like pretti live < br > gun-play to me. ” < br > < br > “ it wasn ’ t no ordinari sailor ’ fraca , ” hoars whisper johnni < br > kent . “ sever of those shot wa fire for ’ ard , and other came from < br > below , about amidship . we heard ’ em through the bulkheads. ” < br > < br > “ and there wa some run to and fro on deck , ” said o ’ shea , “ by men < br > with no shoe on . i heard their bare feet slap the plank over me < br > head. ” < br > < br > “ we haven ’ t been board by pirat , and , anyhow , pirat are out of < br > date in the atlant trade , cap ’ n mike . the ship hasn ’ t stop . it < br > would have wake me in a jiffi if her engin had quit poundin ’ along , < br > even for a minute. ” < br > < br > “ i thought i heard yell , faint and far away , from men in troubl , but < br > ’ ti all quiet now , johnny. ” < br > < br > “ too darn quiet . the vessel ha slow down a trifl , by six or eight < br > revolut , but she ’ s joggin ’ along all seren . shall we take a turn < br > on deck and look around ? ” < br > < br > they move quietli into the long passageway which led to the main < br > saloon staircas . ascend thi , they cross the larg lounging-hal < br > to the nearest exit to the promenad deck . as wa customari , the heavi < br > storm-door had been close for the night . it wa never lock in good < br > weather , howev , and o ’ shea turn the brass knob to thrust it open . < br > the door withstood hi effort , and he put hi shoulder against it in < br > vain . < br > < br > “ ’ ti fasten on the outsid , ” he mutter to johnni kent . “ we are < br > coop up , and for what ? ” < br > < br > “ tri the door on the starboard side of the hall , ” suggest the < br > engin . “ mayb thi one got jam accidental. ” < br > < br > they cross the hall and hammer against the other door with no < br > better success . the situat disturb them . they gaze at each other < br > in silenc . o ’ shea went to one of the bull ’ s-ey window and peer < br > outsid . the steamer wa snore steadili through the quiet sea , and < br > he could discern the crest of the wave as they broke , flash white , < br > and slid past . the electr light on deck had been extinguish , but < br > present a figur pass rapidli and wa visibl for an instant in the < br > shaft of light from one of the saloon passageway . o ’ shea had a glimps < br > of the blue uniform and gilt braid of a ship ’ s offic . < br > < br > “ i wish i could ask him a question or two , ” said o ’ shea . “ let us tri < br > to break out somewher els . now that we seem to be lock in , i am < br > obstin enough to keep on trying. ” < br > < br > they made a tour of the hall , bulkhead passag , and alley , seek < br > everi place of egress from the first-class quarter . everi door had < br > been close and fasten from the other side . a steward wa suppos < br > to be on watch to answer the electr bell in the state-room , but he < br > could not be found . there wa no one to interview , no way of gain < br > inform . < br > < br > the cabin superstructur and partit wall were of steel . the < br > brass-bound port or window were too small for a grown man to wriggl < br > through . the passeng were as effectu confin within their own < br > part of the ship as if they had been lock in a penitentiari . there < br > wa no mean of commun with the ship ’ s offic . < br > < br > it seem useless to awaken the other passeng and inform them of < br > thi singular discoveri . there would be noth but confus , futil < br > argument , and excit . < br > < br > “ mayb the skipper decid to lock us in everi night , ” hope < br > suggest johnni kent . “ if some addle-head gent with a habit of < br > walkin ’ in hi sleep should pranc overboard , the compani might be < br > liabl for heavi damages. ” < br > < br > “ nonsens ! there are strang do aboard thi fine , eleg steamer , ” < br > sharpli return o ’ shea . “ ’ ti too big for me . we will roll into our < br > bunk till morn . i will lose me sleep for no man. ” < br > < br > when johnni kent awok blink and yawn , captain o ’ shea wa < br > stand in front of the open port through which the morn wind < br > gush cool and sweet . the sun had lift abov the horizon and the < br > sea wa bath in rosi radianc . the aspect of the sunris seem to < br > fascin captain o ’ shea , but hi emot wa rather amaz than < br > admir . with a strong ejacul he whirl about to shout at hi < br > comrad : < br > < br > “ do ye notic it , you sleepi old grampu ? doe it look wrong to you ? ” < br > < br > o ’ shea wa danc with excit as he turn again to stare at the < br > cloudless sun and smile sea . johnni kent thought to humor him and < br > amiabl murmur : < br > < br > “ she alway come up in the mornin ’ regular as a clock , cap ’ n mike , and < br > i guess she alway will . ain ’ t she on time , or what ’ s the matter with < br > her ? ” < br > < br > “ the sun is where it belong , ” cri o ’ shea , “ but thi ship is not . her < br > cours ha been shift dure the night . man , we are not on the great < br > circl cours to new york at all . the steamer ha gone mad . we are < br > run due south to fetch to the west ’ ard of the azores. ” < br > < br > “ you don ’ t say ! ” exclaim the engin . “ that sound perfectli < br > ridicul . i guess i ’ d better put on my breech and take a promenad . < br > i wonder do we get ani breakfast in thi crazi packet ? ” < br > < br > the first passeng encount wa jenkin p. chase , whose morn < br > task it wa to walk briskli around the deck , by order of hi physician , < br > befor the other voyag were astir . hi steward had fail to appear < br > with the dri toast and coffe requir to fortifi hi system for thi < br > health exercis , and he wa in a savag temper as he sputter at < br > o ’ shea : < br > < br > “ what infern nonsens is thi ? i can ’ t find a steward or an offic . < br > the servic is rotten , it ’ s posit damnabl . and i can ’ t go on < br > deck . everi door is lock . i ’ ll make it hot for the captain. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti my advic to sit tight and take it easi , mr. chase , ” soothingli < br > return o ’ shea . “ i am afraid the captain ha troubl of hi own thi < br > morning. ” < br > < br > “ what do you mean ? what do you know about it ? who the devil are you ? < br > do you think i have no influenc with the manag of thi miser < br > steamship compani ? ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti a long , wet walk from here to the compani ’ s offic , ” said o ’ shea < br > with an amus smile . “ you are a tremend man ashor , no doubt . i < br > have read about ye in the newspap . but unless i guess wrong , you < br > will take your medicin with the rest of us. ” < br > < br > mr. jenkin p. chase bolt down the staircas into the spaciou < br > dining-saloon . for lack of anyth better to do , o ’ shea and johnni < br > kent follow him . the tabl had been set overnight , but at thi hour < br > of the morn steward should have been wipe down paint , clean < br > brasswork , or get readi to serv breakfast . the room wa silent and < br > desert . < br > < br > jenkin p. chase halt abruptli and hi hand went out in a nervou , < br > puzzl gestur . o ’ shea brush past him and advanc along an aisl < br > between the tabl to the galley or kitchen door at the farther end < br > of the saloon . these , too , were lock , but he could hear the rattl < br > of pan and pot and a sound of voic , as if the cook had begun the < br > day ’ s work . < br > < br > “ that is the first cheer symptom , ” he said to himself . “ the news < br > will put heart into johnni kent , though i wish there were more < br > indic of circulatin ’ the grub among the passengers. ” < br > < br > the dictatori manner of jenkin p. chase had becom oddli subdu . < br > < br > “ you said we must take our medicin ? ” he remark to o ’ shea . “ for god ’ s < br > sake , what is wrong with thi ship ? ” < br > < br > “ i know veri littl , my dear man . we were lock in dure the night , < br > clap under hatch , as the say is . and the cours of the < br > vessel wa alter to head her for the south atlant instead of the < br > newfoundland banks. ” < br > < br > “ but noth of the sort could possibl happen on a steamer like the < br > _alsatian_ , ” protest mr. chase . “ i mean to say there could be no < br > blood-and-thund busi on an atlant liner. ” < br > < br > “ a lot of thing have happen at sea that were perfectli imposs , ” < br > grave spoke johnni kent . < br > < br > as if the mysteri had commun itself in some subtl , telepath < br > fashion , the passeng began to appear from their state-room at an < br > earlier hour than usual . unabl to go on deck , they congreg in the < br > hall , the librari , and the parlor . rumor spread swiftli and intens < br > uneasi pervad the compani . for some inscrut reason they had < br > been made prison . thi much wa evid . the realiz inspir a < br > feel akin to panic . angri denunci , with not a solitari member < br > of the ship ’ s crew discover , sound rather foolish . the men < br > loudest in air their opinion soon subsid and eye one anoth in < br > a mood of glum bewilder . one or two women laugh hyster . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea look about to find that friendli scientist professor < br > ernst wilhelm vonderholtz , who wa usual readi with a cordial morn < br > greet . he wa not among the assembl passeng . presum he wa < br > still in hi state-room . a few minut after thi o ’ shea found occas < br > to stroll past the professor ’ s door , which stood open . the room wa < br > empti . < br > < br > inexplic , persist , the person of the blond scientist had < br > link itself with o ’ shea ’ s strang sens of forebod . he decid < br > to investig the empti state-room , for he observ at onc that the < br > bed had not been disarrang in either berth . < br > < br > “ nobodi slept in here last night , ” said o ’ shea to himself . < br > < br > the room contain no luggag , and no person effect except < br > sever articl of discard cloth . o ’ shea pick up a coat < br > and examin it curious . the pocket were empti , but he made an < br > interest discoveri . the label stitch insid the collar bore the < br > name of a well-known ready-mad cloth firm of broadway , new york . < br > < br > “ and he told us it wa hi first trip to our wonder countri , ” wa < br > o ’ shea ’ s comment . “ as a liar he ha me beaten both way from the jack. ” < br > < br > he resum hi care investig of the room , and wa reward by < br > discov a pair of gold-rim spectacl on the floor beneath the < br > lower berth , where they must have been purpos toss asid . it wa < br > reason to conclud that the owner had no more use for them . < br > < br > “ the bird ha flown , ” soliloqu o ’ shea , gaze hard at the < br > spectacl and handl them rather gingerli , as if they might be < br > bewitch . “ he couldn ’ t fli overboard . anyhow , he didn ’ t . i ’ ll bet me < br > head on that . and he ha not elop with the black-ey school-teach , < br > for i saw her in the librari just now . and where would they elop to ? < br > he must be still in the ship. ” < br > < br > in a veri thought mood he return to the main staircas , where < br > johnni kent wa hope peer in the direct of the dining-saloon . < br > < br > “ there ’ s someth doin ’ down there , ” announc the engin . “ the < br > door were shut and bolt from the insid a few minut ago . mayb < br > they ’ ll open again pretti soon and the bell will ring for grub. ” < br > < br > “ forget that aw appetit and listen to me , ” exclaim o ’ shea . “ the < br > professor ha vanish entirely. ” < br > < br > “ commit suicid , you suppos ? if he realli fell in love with the < br > school-teach , it ’ s not unlik , cap ’ n mike . it take ’ em that way < br > sometim . i ’ ve felt like it myself onc or twice. ” < br > < br > “ if he jump overboard , he took hi baggag with him . and he had a < br > coupl of hand-bag when he came on board , for i saw them . ’ ti more < br > like the divil flew away with him . here ’ s hi spectacl . he left < br > them behind . i tell ye , johnni kent , and you may laugh at me all ye < br > like , for you are a much older man than me , and you ought to be wiser , < br > which you are not -- that chemic gentleman wa not as mild and nice as < br > he made out . hi eye wa bad . and he ha brought troubl to thi ship . < br > where is he now ? can ye answer that ? ” < br > < br > “ one of those revolv bullet may have perfor him while he wa < br > strollin ’ on deck and figurin ’ out some new problem in chemistry. ” < br > < br > “ your

joke of < br > a predica we are in , ye can take my word for it. ” < br > < br > miss jen wa to be discern , at a casual glanc , as a young woman < br > with a mind of her own . the bold o ’ shea approach her timidli , hi < br > courag ooz . her black eye survey him coldli and critic and < br > made him feel as though hi feet were sever size too larg . < br > < br > “ i beg pardon , ” he stammer , “ but have ye heard that the professor is < br > miss ? ” < br > < br > surpris and alarm drove the color from her face . evid the tide < br > came as a shock to her . her perturb fail wholli to convinc < br > o ’ shea that she could furnish no clew to the mysteri . one question < br > should have leap swiftli to her lip . it wa the one question to ask . < br > wa it suppos that professor vonderholtz had commit suicid by < br > leap overboard ? captain o ’ shea wait for her to say someth of < br > the sort . she sat pale and silent . the dark , handsom , matur young < br > woman baffl him . he felt that he wa no match for her . < br > < br > “ ’ ti not a case of suicid , miss jen , ” said he . < br > < br > “ then what is it , may i ask ? ” she repli in even tone . < br

no impress that he wa not a univers < br > professor at all , but anoth kind of man entir ? ” stubbornli pursu < br > o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ i did not discuss hi profess . chemistri doe not

all aback to hear the news that < br > he can not be found thi morn . i grant ye that , but you know more < br > about him than ye will tell me . i have said me say , miss jenness. ” < br > < br > she paid no heed to him , but rose abruptli and walk in the direct < br > of her state-room . o ’ shea watch her until she vanish , and then he < br > murmur with an air of chagrin : < br > < br > “ i may be a pretti fair shipmast , but as a detect ye can mark < br > me down as a failur . ’ twa a random shot about their know each < br > other ashor , though i have a notion it land somewher near the <

< br > “ it sure ain ’ t right for us to knuckl under , cap ’ n mike , without < br > put up an almighti stiff argument . we ’ ve fought our way out of some < br > pretti tight corners. ” < br > < br

the tabl , upon which had been set dish of oatmeal , potato , ham < br > and egg , and pot of coffe . the galley and pantri door were still < br > close . not a steward wa visibl . the passeng must help themselv . < br > they could eat thi simpl fare or leav it alon . < br > < br > the dining-saloon seem empti , uncanni . except for the steadi < br > vibrat of the engin , it wa as though the ship had been desert < br > by her crew . such talk as went on wa in low tone . there wa in the < br > air a feel that hostil influenc , unseen , unheard , but veri < br > menac , were all around them . they ate to satisfi hunger , glanc < br > often at the empti chair of the command and the chief offic of the < br > _alsatian_ . o ’ shea wa more interest in the vacant chair of professor < br > ernst wilhelm vonderholtz . < br > < br > a few peopl carri tray and plate of food to their room , as < br > if to make sure of the next meal . palpit uncertainti and dread < br > were the emot common

a council of < br > war. ” < br > < br > they made a slow , painstak tour of the first-cabin quarter and < br > convinc themselv that everi exit from the steel deck-hous < br > wa still secur fasten . then they sought everi window port < br > which command a view of the upper deck or superstructur of the < br > ship . they were unabl to catch a glimps , from ani angl , of the < br > canvas-screen bridg or to discov whether the captain and the < br > navig offic were on duti as usual . upon the forward part of the < br > ship they descri sever seamen at work . down below the rumbl of an < br >

the passeng so mysteri imprison in the first-cabin quarter < br > were soon to meet again that vanish scientist and fellow-voyag < br > professor ernst wilhelm vonderholtz . shortli befor noon one of the < br > door which had block exit to the promenade-deck wa open from < br > the outsid . an alert , blond man step upon the brass threshold and < br > stood gaze at the huddl , wonder passeng . the

harmless professor of chemistri . < br > < br > behind him , and fill the doorway , stood four other men in the grimi < br > garment of the stoke-hol . the smear of coal-dust which blacken < br > their featur gave them a forbid , sinist appear . they were < br > openli arm with revolv . their leader motion them to remain where < br > they were . he move just insid the hall and address the passeng < br > in hi clean-cut english with it teuton shade and inton . the < br > audienc wa flatteringli attent . the sight of the four grim stoker < br > in the background compel absorb attent . <

most care < br > plan . i will explain a littl in order that you may know whi it is < br > best for you to do as you are order . the strike of those firemen < br > in liverpool ? it wa foment by my agent . they caus the strike < br > to occur on the day of sail . it wa necessari to get rid of that < br > crew of firemen . in their place were ship my own -- our own men . < br > the compani wa

acut mind of jenkin p. chase had alreadi conclud that these two < br > men were ready-wit and unafraid . he mark their bear , and he wa < br > impress with the fact that o ’ shea had been awar of

< br > < br > “ i have read in the newspap that mr. jenkin p. chase onc stole a < br > railroad , ” pleasantli return o ’ shea . “ mayb you can figur it out < br > better than us two sailormen how vonderholtz stole a steamship. ” < br > < br > “ a good hit ! you ’ re not so slow yourself , ” cri the other , not in the < br > least offend . < br > < br > “ the steamer is steer into southern

“ he said someth about chuck me overboard , ” sigh jenkin p. < br > chase . < br > < br > “ and he look as if he meant it , ” amiabl observ johnni kent . < br > < br > with thi , the twain bade the millionair take heart and left him < br > to hi unhappi medit . an idea had come to johnni kent and he < br > wish to thrash it over with hi comrad in the seclus of their < br > own room . for a long time they argu it , test everi detail , o ’ shea < br > dissuad , but convinc against hi will that the thing should be < br > attempt . it wa a desper hazard , a forlorn hope , and gray-hair , < br > honest old johnni kent must stake hi life . success meant the recaptur < br > of the ship , and the engin wa obstin determin to undertak < br > it . < br > < br > “ you will have to go it alon ,

will you ? it ’ ll be my last wish. ” < br > < br > “ i promis to fill him full of hole , if hi gang pot me next minut , ” < br > simpli repli o ’ shea , and they shook hand on it . < br > < br > after dark that night johnni kent rummag in hi steamer trunk and < br > fish out an oil-stain suit of blue overal , hi work uniform < br > when in activ servic . from anoth bundl he select two power <

dog-ear copi < br > of the _american poultri journal_ by way of pass the time , captain < br > o ’ shea return to the librari and call togeth a dozen of the men < br > passeng whom he knew to be depend . he had alreadi explain what < br > they were to do , and without attract the notic of the sentri < br > post at the outsid doorway , they heap in a corner of the librari < br > all the combust materi they could lay their hand on , mostli < br > newspap and magazin . sever contribut empti cigar box , < br > anoth a crate in which fruit had been brought aboard , and jenkin p. < br >

a great deal of < br > smoke . < br > < br > while the men were thu engag captain o ’ shea chanc to notic the < br > school-teach , miss jen , who halt while pass the librari < br > door . she move nearer , listen intent to the talk , and then turn < br > away to walk rapidli in the direct of the starboard exit to the deck . < br > < br > suspect her purpos , o ’ shea follow and overtook her . between her < br > and vonderholtz some sort of an understand exist , some relat < br > more intim than she wa will to reveal . o ’ shea wa alert to < br > prevent her from spoil hi plan . she might not intend to play the < br > part of a spi , but her behavior had been mysteri and she wa not to < br > be trust . < br > < br > o ’ shea call her name sharpli , and the girl paus . he move to her <

hesit , at a loss for word , and o ’ shea felt certain that he < br > had guess her motiv aright . hi decis wa instant and ruthless . < br > stand close to her , he said : < br > < br > “ you will be good enough to go to your state-room for the rest of < br > thi night , miss jen , and ye will go at onc , move no nearer < br > the sentri or the deck , and make no outcri . ’ ti a most impolit < br > speech to make to a handsom girl like yourself , but i have no time for < br > courtesy. ” < br > < br > miss jen glanc asid . captain o ’ shea stood between her and the < br > passag to the deck . then she look at him , and knew that he meant < br > what he said . her lip part , her breath wa short and quick , and she < br > move not for a long moment . it wa a clash of strong will , but the < br > woman realiz that she wa beaten . < br > < br > it meant death to o ’ shea should he be discov in the act of set < br > fire to the ship , but he wa fight for more than hi own skin . the < br > issu appeal to him as curious imperson . hi own safeti had < br > becom a trifl matter . he wa mere an instrument in the hand of < br > fate , an agent commiss to help thwart the tragic destini that < br > overhung the vessel and her peopl . the girl wa an episod ; not so < br > much a person as a cog of the mysteri , evil mechan devis < br > by the blond beast vonderholtz . < br > < br > “ i think i will go to my room , ” said miss jen . < br > < br > “ thank you . ’ ti wiser , ” softli repli o ’ shea . < br > < br > so fatuous confid wa vonderholtz that hi plan were invulner < br > that he had taken no precaut to have the first-cabin quarter < br > patrol and inspect beyond the exit . he had herd the passeng < br > like a flock of sheep and concern himself no further about them . they < br > could start no upris by themselv , and unarm . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea felt confid that the men in possess of the ship < br > could get the fire under control . at ani rate , it must burn itself out < br > within the steel wall of the deck-hous . state-room and hall might < br > be gut , but he quot hi favorit adag that one can not make an < br > omelet without break egg . for hi part , he would rather burn and < br > sink the ship than meekli to surrend to thi mob of pirat . < br > < br > thereupon he scratch a match and touch off the fire . wet down < br > with alcohol , the newspap blaze up fierc and the flame lick < br > the paintwork of shelv and panel . smoke drove into the hall in < br > thick gust . the passeng , some of them genuin frighten , shout < br > lustili , and there wa much confus . < br > < br > o ’ shea wa delight . hi conflagr wa a success . the sentri at < br > the doorway and the men on deck ran in pell-mel and dash out again < br > to find hose and bucket . they bawl order to one anoth and were < br > bewild by the smoke which billow into the passag . < br > < br > befor the hose line had been drag in and while the fire wa < br > uncheck , a bulki figur in blue overal , hi face blacken as < br > with coal-dust , emerg from a state-room , peer cautious into the < br > smoke , and with tread surprisingli agil for hi weight and year , ran < br > straight toward the crowd of men in the larg hall outsid the blaze < br > librari . the smoke effectu curtain hi dash for the deck . the < br > doorway had been left unguard . those whom he shove out of hi way < br > mistook him for one of vonderholtz ’ s crew . < br > < br > the stratagem of the fire enabl johnni kent to escap from the < br > steel-wal prison and to run the gauntlet of the guard on deck . at < br > top speed he clatter down a ladder to the next deck below , slow hi < br > gait , and stood puf to regain hi breath , for he wa a short-wind < br > hero and ampl of girth . < br > < br > in the print matter advertis the intern line he had < br > discov a plan of the _alsatian_ , drawn with much detail . he knew < br > it by heart , and wa confid that he would not go astray in the < br > labyrinth of her mani deck and bulkhead passag . moreov , he wa a < br > man with a live interest in hi call , and when the _alsatian_ wa < br > launch he had studi the descript of her machineri and the like < br > with a keen profession eye . < br > < br > without hesit he step nimbl through an iron door amidship and < br > enter a narrow alley light by an electr bulb . a man , also clad < br > in the overal of a fireman or machinist , brush past him , and said , < br > without look up : < br > < br > “ fire amount to anyth ? ” < br > < br > “ a stream of water will dous it , ” gruffli answer johnni kent as he < br > emerg from the alley into the great , clangor open space abov < br > the engine-room . below him ran iron ladder and platform , flight < br > after flight , past the huge , shine cylind , down to the toil < br > piston-rod and the whirl crank-shaft . dynamo pur and auxiliari < br > engin hum in shadowi corner and the pump beat time to thi < br > titan anthem . < br > < br > johnni kent wipe the drip sweat from hi face and the burnt cork < br > smear itself in grotesqu streak and blotch . he had reason it < br > out that among a hundr and fifti men sail togeth for the first < br > time he could pass unchalleng long enough to serv hi purpos . and < br > now that he had gain the engine-room hi veri presenc there would < br > safeguard him against suspicion . men were come and go , and sever < br > of the fire-room gang chat with the engin on watch . it would < br > be easier to mingl with them becaus of thi fratern slack of < br > disciplin . < br > < br > hi stout heart thump against hi rib , but hi spirit undaunt , < br > johnni kent step from the lowest ladder to the grate of the < br > engine-room floor . pull the greasi black cap low over hi eye , he < br > dodg behind a steam-pip and made for the entranc to the nearest < br > fire-room . strip to the waist in the red glare , the stoker were < br > rattl coal into furnac door . johnni kent said never a word , but < br > pick up a shovel and took hi station in front of a boiler . an < br > offic of some sort shout at him : < br > < br > “ who sent you down ? ” < br > < br > “ i wa order to shift my watch , ” bellow johnni kent . < br > < br > “ good enough . we are short-hand , ” wa the repli . < br > < br > the heat and the arduou exert made johnni kent grunt , but he had < br > been a mighti man with a shovel in hi time , and he would show these < br > scoundrel how to feed a furnac . he observ that arm guard were < br > station in thi compart , and conclud that some of the steamer ’ s < br > regular crew had been set to work under compuls . < br > < br > thu far he had made no blunder . there had been no flaw in hi plan . < br > hi greatest fear wa that vonderholtz might come below and recogn < br > him . but the conflagr conduct by captain o ’ shea wa like to < br > keep the leader on deck . < br > < br > painstakingli johnni kent sought to recal everi scrap of inform < br > he had read in technic journal concern the under-wat < br > specif of the _alsatian_ . hi memori wa tenaci and he < br > believ that he could trust it now . < br > < br > he had enter the fire-room in the middl of a watch , and therefor < br > had not long to serv as a stoker befor the men were reliev and < br > anoth gang took their place . when the next watch came troop in , < br > there wa much pass to and fro , and as one of the crowd johnni kent < br > felt much safer against discoveri . he knew where to find dark corner < br > and tortuou passageway in thi complex , noisi part of the ship , far < br > below the water-lin . < br > < br > when the firemen of hi watch began to climb the ladder to their < br > live quarter , he wa not among them . two hour later , a bulki < br > gray-head person in blue overal might have been seen crawl < br > on hand and knee or wriggl on hi stomach in the bilg of the < br > _alsatian ’ s_ hull , beneath the floor . < br > < br > from the state-room wall he had unscrew the small candl lamp < br > provid for use when the electric-light system wa turn off . with < br > thi feebl light he wa search for the sea-cock , those massiv < br > valv set into the bottom of a steamer ’ s hull for the purpos of < br > let in the ocean and flood her in the emerg of fire in the < br > cargo hold and coal-bunk . a steamer is sometim save from total < br > destruct by beach her in shoal water and open the sea-cock . < br > < br > to open these valv in the bottom of the _alsatian_ wa to admit a < br > rush of water which would soon rise to the furnac and engine-room in < br > greater volum than the steam-pump could hold in check . it wa not < br > johnni kent ’ s mad intent to sink the liner in mid-ocean , although < br > thi wa a possibl consequ . < br > < br > after prodigi exert , he found what he sought and bent hi burli < br > strength to releas the gate-valv construct to withstand the < br > pressur of the sea . he heard the water pour in with sob gush < br > and murmur and splash against the steel plate and beam . with a < br > healthi prejudic against be drown in a cataract of hi own < br > devis , johnni kent scrambl in retreat and regain the engine-room < br > compart , bruis and exhaust . < br > < br > thu far he had succeed becaus of the sheer audac of the < br > enterpris . it wa a seemingli imposs thing to do , but the process < br > of reason which inspir it wa particularli sane and cool-head . < br > he had been unchalleng becaus it never enter the mind of hi foe < br > that ani one would dare such a stratagem . they had gain the upper < br > hand by mean of forc . in a game of wit they were out-manœuvr . < br > johnni kent show the superior intellig . < br > < br > “ it look as if my job as daniel in the lion ’ den wa about done , ” he < br > said to himself . < br > < br > he becam a stowaway until the next watch wa chang in the fire-room . < br > then he mingl with the crowd of sooti men who went off duti . < br > unmolest , he clamber up the ladder , slip into an alley-way , < br > and came to the promenad deck with the bless open sky abov him . < br > ostentati swing a wrench , he ambl aft and reconnoitr the < br > entranc to the first-cabin quarter . men were drag out line of < br > hose , other chop away char woodwork and pitch it overboard . < br > one of them paus to look at the larg grimi person in overal , but < br > he display the wrench and casual explain : < br > < br > “ order from the engine-room . the heat warp the skylight fit . < br > hot work , wasn ’ t it ? ” < br > < br > onc insid the doorway , johnni kent made for hi state-room , which < br > had been untouch by fire . o ’ shea saw him pass , but made no sign of < br > recognit . a few minut later the comrad twain were hold a glad < br > reunion behind the bolt door . the engin collaps on the transom < br > berth and sat in a ponder heap , hold hi head in hi hand . < br > < br > “ my leg are trembl and i feel all gone in the pit of my stummick , < br > cap ’ n mike , ” he huskili croak . “ i wa plumb near scare to death . < br > thi easi livin ’ ha made me soft , and i ain ’ t as young as i wa . but i < br > got away with it. ” < br > < br > “ how ? ’ ti a miracl ye have perform thi night , johnni , me boy. ” < br > < br > “ i let in the water and she ’ ll flood herself , ” wa the weari repli . “ it < br > wa easi after i onc ran the blockad . what about your bonfir ? she < br > wa a corker by the look of things. ” < br > < br > “ she wa that , ” laugh o ’ shea . “ vonderholtz came boilin ’ in with hi < br > men and put it out after a tussl . he suspect we touch it off , but < br > he could not prove it . it wa the stump of a cigar that some careless < br > gentleman toss into the librari waste-basket , ye understand . let me < br > help you get your cloth off . lie down and rest yourself. ” < br > < br > kick off the overal , johnni kent light hi pipe , stretch < br > himself in hi bunk , and exclaim : < br > < br > “ i ’ ll turn in with my dud on . we are liabl to be rous out between < br > now and morning. ” < br > < br > “ are ye sure the ship will not go to the bottom ? ” anxious ask < br > o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ i won ’ t swear to it , cap ’ n mike , but thi is a well-built steamer , < br > and she wa new a year ago . her bulkhead will stand up under a lot < br > of pressur . the engin and fire room compart will fill to the < br > water-lin , but she ’ ll float , or i ’ ve made a darn bad blunder. ” < br > < br > “ you know your busi , johnni . if the blackguard think she is < br > sink under them , ’ ti all we ask. ” < br > < br > “ tuck me in and wash my face , ” murmur the engin . “ i ’ m too doggon < br > tire to worri about it. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea made him comfort and withdrew to keep an eye on event . < br > order had been restor . the passeng were onc more close guard , < br > and as a new precaut sentri were station in the hall . o ’ shea < br > wait until the men with revolv were reliev at midnight and < br > anoth squad took their place . then he heard one of them say to < br > anoth that there wa seriou troubl below . the ship had run over a < br > bit of submerg wreckag or somehow damag her bottom plate . she wa < br > leak . the water wa make into the midship compart . < br > < br > to o ’ shea thi wa the best news in the world . with an easier mind , he < br > went to hi room . the hate inact , the humili imprison , < br > were almost over . god help him , he would whip thi

the engin are no more than turnin ’ < br > over . that mean the water is almost up to the furnac and the men < br > are desertin ’ their post . you can ’ t keep firemen below when the black < br > water is sloshin ’ under their feet . it get their nerve. ” < br > < br > “ the whole crew will go to piec if the panicki feel onc take < br > hold of them , johnni . they have never work togeth . a lot of them < br > are no seamen at all . and vonderholtz will not be abl to hold them. ” < br > < br > the _alsatian_ move more and more sluggishli , like a die ship . < br > the water wa pour into her faster than the pump could lift it < br > oversid . it wa onli a question of hour befor the fire would be < br > extinguish , the machineri still , and the liner no more than a < br > sodden hulk roll aimlessli in the atlant . < br > < br > the passeng were no longer under guard . they walk the deck as < br > they pleas . the commun brethren , who had found it so easi to < br > captur the ship , were now at their wit ’ end . onc or twice their < br > leader pass hastili between the bridg and the engine-room . the < br > confid , sneer egot no longer mark the demeanor of the man . < br > nervous twist hi blond beard , he move as one without definit < br > purpos . hi elabor enterpris wa in a bad way . the war against < br > societi had suffer an unexpect revers . < br > < br > o ’ shea and johnni kent watch him gloatingli . the advantag wa all < br > their . they were wait for the right moment to strike , and to < br > strike hard . they saw vonderholtz halt to speak to miss jen , who < br > stood apart and alon . he argu with fieri gestur . she protest < br > earnestli , her face sad and tragic . it wa as though they had come to < br > the part of the way . < br > < br > at length the _alsatian_ ceas to forg ahead . the water conquer < br > her . the long , black hull rode low , sag wearili to starboard . the < br > bulkhead still held firm , but it seem inevit that she must < br > shortli plung to the bottom . < br > < br > vonderholtz and hi men were between the devil and the deep sea in more < br > way than one . they dare signal no pass vessel and ask assist , < br > for the gallow await them ashor . mani of them were for abandon < br > the liner at onc . it wa useless , they argu , to wait until she < br > founder under their feet . the _alsatian_ had becom unten . < br > < br > refus to acknowledg that ruin had overtaken hi splendid < br > conspiraci , vonderholtz storm like a madman at the coward who would < br > take to the boat . he swore he would stand by the ship until she went < br > down . were they to abandon the two million in gold ? it wa imposs < br > to save it in the boat . castaway could not explain the possess of < br > a fortun in treasur . < br > < br > the mutin , who had openli broken away from their leader , repli < br > that they would quit the ship and take chanc of be pick up or of < br > make a land at the azor . let the crew and passeng drown in < br > the ship , and good riddanc to them . < br > < br > the dissens increas , the bravest of the rascal resolut < br > stand by vonderholtz . those who were for desert the liner < br > began to crowd to the boat and swing them out , readi for lower . < br > disciplin had vanish . < br > < br > captain michael o ’ shea said a word to johnni kent , who pull hi < br > revolv from the breast of hi shirt . twenti of the passeng were < br > readi for the order . some had arm themselv with piec of steel < br > pipe unscrew from the frame of the state-room berth . other < br > flourish club of scantl save from the wreckag of the fire . they < br > were men unus to violenc -- lawyer , merchant , even a clergyman -- but < br > they were readi to risk their live to win freedom from their shame < br > plight . < br > < br > the compact littl band swept out on deck like a cyclon . o ’ shea and < br > johnni kent open fire , shoot to kill . the enemi wa taken in flank < br > and in rear . those who were busi with the boat tumbl into them . < br > befor the rush of the passeng could be check they had clear a < br > path forward and gain the stairway to the bridge-deck . scatter < br > shot wound one or two , but shelter wa found behind the wheel-hous < br > and chart-room . < br > < br > o ’ shea ran to the captain ’ s quarter and enter with fear in hi < br > heart . the room wa empti , but there wa blood on the floor and sign < br > of a struggl . < br > < br > “ they did away with him , ” o ’ shea cri , hi voic choke . “ he die like < br > a brave sailor . now for the officers. ” < br > < br > snatch an axe from the rack in the wheel-hous , he jump for the < br > row of cabin . the first door wa lock and he smash it in with < br > mighti blow . the chief offic of the _alsatian_ wa discov < br > within , iron on hi wrist , a nasti wound slant across hi forehead . < br > < br > “ take me out of thi and give me a gun , ” sob the stalwart englishman . < br > < br > “ how about the rest of ye ? ” shout o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ they shot the old man and club hayden , second offic , to death . < br > the other are alive. ” < br > < br > “ lay your hand on the rail yonder and hold steadi , ” o ’ shea command < br > him . “ i will shear the link of those bracelet with the axe. ” < br > < br > thi done they broke into the other room and releas the surviv < br > junior offic who had been surpris while asleep . rage and < br > curs , they caught up axe and iron belaying-pin and join o ’ shea < br > in the salli to releas the seamen lock up in the forecastl and the < br > steward pen below . recogn the grave danger , vonderholtz tri < br > to ralli hi arm men and hold the boat-deck against attack . but hi < br > forc wa divid and disorgan and part of it wa in the boat . hi < br > power had crumbl in a moment . he wa on the defens , fight for < br > life . < br > < br > now the crew of the _alsatian_ came swarm against him , even the < br > steward no longer obsequi slave of the tray and napkin but yelp < br > like wolv . heedless of bullet , the larg forc led by o ’ shea , johnni < br > kent , and the chief offic of the _alsatian_ charg with irresist < br > feroc . they pen forti of the commun brotherhood between the < br > rail and the deck-hous amidship , and fairli hammer and jam them < br > through the nearest doorway and made them prison . < br > < br > vonderholtz comprehend that the ship wa lost to him and that it wa < br > everi man for himself and flight into the boat . he somehow got clear < br > of the whirl conflict , found room to turn , and stood with hi back < br > to a derrick-mast while he let drive with hi pistol and put a bullet < br > through o ’ shea ’ s arm . < br > < br > roar vengeanc , johnni kent would have kill the blond leader in < br > hi track , but just then miss jen ran swiftli to vonderholtz , < br > caught hold of hi hand , and urg him frantic toward the nearest < br > boat . johnni kent forbor to shoot . he could not hit hi target without < br > drive a bullet through the girl . nor did ani man hinder them , as < br > vonderholtz and miss jen , dark , tragic , incomprehens , move < br > quickli to the edg of the ship and leap into the crowd boat that < br > had just swung clear . it descend from the overhang davit and < br > plop into the smooth sea . as the fall were unhook at the bow and < br > stern , the men on the thwart set the long oar in the thole-pin and < br > clumsili push away from the side of the liner . < br > < br > it would have been easi to shoot vonderholtz from the deck abov , but < br > he crouch in the stern-sheet with the girl cling close at hi < br > side , so that she seem to be tri to shield him . no one wa will < br > to risk kill the woman in order to deal retribut to the chief < br > crimin . < br > < br > “ blaze away at the other boat ! kill all you can ! ” shout the chief < br > offic of the _alsatian_ . “ shoot into the thick of them befor they < br > pull out of rang ! ” < br > < br > “ let them go , ” grave counsel o ’ shea , who wa tri to bandag hi < br > bleed arm . “ god almighti will hand out justic to them . those boat < br > will not live through the first squall , for they are overcrowd and < br > there are few seamen amongst them. ” < br > < br > the law crew of the _alsatian_ gather togeth and watch the < br > boat drift to leeward . there wa no more shoot by either side . it < br > wa as if a truce had been declar . johnni kent made a trumpet of hi < br > hand and shout in tremend tone to the boat in which vonderholtz < br > had escap : < br > < br > “ we trick you and we whip you , you cowardli dog . the ship will < br > float and she ’ ll be tow to port . the laugh is on you , and you can put < br > that in your pipe and smoke it , my gay chemic professor. ” < br > < br > cri of rage aros from the boat , but there wa no return to the < br > liner , no possibl way of scale her tower side . her own crew < br > held possess of her as secur as if they were in a fortress . the < br > wind freshen briskli and the boat drift farther and farther away < br > to leeward . the men who fill them must face the dread peril < br > and suffer of castaway in mid-ocean . at length the boat becam < br > no more than white speck , and then they vanish beyond the misti < br > horizon . < br > < br > “ if vonderholtz could have had hi way he would have destroy the ship < br > with everi soul in her befor he abandon her , ” said o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ he had me on the list , ” pipe up jenkin p. chase , who strut < br > importantli , for he had knock down a foeman and club him into < br > submiss . “ now , about that young woman , miss jen . hang if she <

wa afraid to oppos him for fear she < br > would lose him entir . and mayb he persuad her to make thi voyag < br > with him and he would take her away to live with him somewher and be < br > happi . ’

across from south america with an empti hold , sight the _alsatian_ < br > helpless and fli signal of distress . the humbl skipper of thi < br > beggarli craft could not believ hi eye . hi wildest , most fantast < br > dream of salvag were about to come true . as he steam alongsid the < br > chief offic of the liner shout : < br > < br > “ tow us to new york and settl with the owners. ” < br > < br > “ will i ? ” bawl the bewhisk skipper , danc a jig . “ i ’ ll hang < br > onto my end of the bloomin ’ hawser as long as thi hooker of mine will < br > float . are you stove up insid ? broke a shaft ? ” < br > < br > “ no . engine-room full of water . we open the sea-cock on purpose. ” < br > < br > “ you ’ re drunk or crazi , ” cri the skipper ; “ but i will tow you to < br > hade for the price that will be award for thi job. ” < br > < br > it wa a plucki undertak for the under-engin , under-man tramp , < br > but the _alsatian_ sent extra hand aboard , and the two vessel crept < br > slowli in toward the atlant coast , swung to the northward , and after < br > a tediou voyag came in sight of sandi hook . the wild and tragic < br > experi through which she had pass seem incred to those on < br > board . so mani day overdu wa thi crack liner of the intern < br > servic that tug had been sent to search for her . the newspap < br > report her as miss and probabl lost . < br > <

with a friendli smile , < br > “ forget it . you are a great littl man , and we forgiv you for be so < br > rich , but ’ twa not the kind of a job that seafarin ’ men take money for < br > from a

andiron were polish like gold . < br > the woodwork glisten with speckless white paint . what furnitur < br > there wa consist of solid , old-fashion piec , such as windsor < br > chair , a highboy , a claw-foot tabl or two , and a desk of bird ’ s-ey < br > mapl . no bric-a-brac clutter them . habit had school thi nautic < br > housekeep to dispens with loos stuff which might go adrift in a < br

such boyish zest . < br > < br > step to the back door , he blew a blast on a tin horn to summon the < br > perkin boy . that lazi urchin sped out of the onion bed as if he had < br > wing , and johnni kent wa move to comment : < br > < br > “ be care , bub , or your famili ’ ll disown you . you came bowlin ’ along < br > to your vittl like you were actual aliv ! right after dinner you < br >

down from < br > it hook . < br > < br > “ you can tell ’ em with my compliment that they ’ re a gabbi lot of < br > gossip and ought to have a stopper put on their jaw-tackl , ” return < br > johnni kent with surpris heat and a percept blush . “ i can look < br > after myself without ani advic from the village. ” < br > < br > young perkin snicker and thought it wise to chang the subject . < br > when they sat down to tabl , the host wa in the best of humor as he < br > declaim with tremend gusto : < br > < br > “ did you ever tast such pea ? rais ’ em myself . cook in cream from < br > my own

landscap far and near . < br > < br > “ i smell wood smoke , sure as gun , ” said johnni kent . < br > < br > “ so did i. i bet a cooki it ’ s anoth fire , ” excitedli cri young < br > perkin . “ i can ’ t see anyth , can you ? ” < br > < br > “ not yet . the wood have been afir seven time in the last week , and < br > it ain ’ t accident , bub . the build will begin to go next . my farm < br > ha been spare so far. ” < br > < br > the boy wa climb into an apple-tre , from which perch he wa abl < br > to gaze over the hill beyond the pastur . he could see a hazi cloud of < br > smoke drift among the pine growth of a neighbor farm and in the < br > undergrowth glow littl spurt of flame like crimson ribbon . the < br > fire had gain small headway , but unless speedili check it might < br

mare in the buggi . it ’ s a case of all hand turnin ’ out again. ” < br > < br > the call of duti had never found the stout-heart marin indiffer , < br > and a few minut later he wa drive down the countri road under < br > forc draught , the vehicl bound over rock and rut , and the < br > perkin boy hang on with both hand . alreadi the alarm had spread , < br > and farmer were leav their mow machin and hay-rack in the < br > field to hurri in the direct of the burn woodland . wagon load < br > with men came rattl out from the villag . two or three of the < br > recent fire , so mysteri frequent , had done much damag , and the < br > neighborhood wa alert to respond . < br > < br > experi had taught the volunt forc how to oper . they dash < br > into the woodland and fought the fire at close rang . some wet sack < br > in a near-bi brook and beat out the fli ember and the blaze < br > grass . other shovel sand and earth upon the creep skirmish-lin < br > of the conflagr . the most agil climb the tree , which were < br > just begin to catch , and chop off the flame , sizzl < br > branch . they toil like hero , regardless of the wilt heat and < br > blind , choke smoke . < br > < br > johnni kent wa not a man to spare himself , and he rage in the < br > fore-front of the embattl farmer , exert himself prodigi , < br > shout order , take command as a matter of habit . the other obey < br > him , be afraid to do anyth els , although they knew more about < br > fight forest fire than he . the elderli marin engin had grown < br > unaccustom to such violent endeavor , and he puf and grunt huge < br > and ran river of perspir . < br > < br > so promptli had the neighbor muster that the flame were conquer < br > befor they could jump into the thickest part of the woodland and < br > swirl through the top of the pine . leav a patrol to search the < br > undergrowth in search of stray spark , the farmer withdrew from the < br > blacken area and gather togeth to listen to the excit stori of < br > a young man arm with a shot-gun . < br > < br > “ thi ain ’ t the first fire that ’ s been set on my properti , ” said he . < br > “ my pastur wa touch off in three

and nobodi know where it will happen next . as i wa about < br > to say , when i fust seen the smoke thi afternoon i wa on the other < br > side of the young growth , and i put for it as hard as i could . and i < br > saw a man sneakin ’ away from the fire . i threw up my gun to give him a < br > dose of buckshot , but he dodg among the tree and wa over the hill < br > and down in the hollow befor you could say jack robinson . i ain ’ t veri < br > speedi sinc i wa throw out of the dingle-cart and broke my leg , and < br > the strang man got away from me. ” < br > < br > “ he ’ s the

< br > < br > johnni kent wa too weari to take much interest in a man-hunt , even < br > with the magnific larg of twenti dollar in prospect . summon < br > the perkin boy , who wa heav rock at a small turtl on the bank < br > of the brook , he clamber heavili into the buggi and turn the mare < br > toward the road . the afternoon had been spoil and the worthi marin < br > wa in a disgruntl mood . a serpent had enter hi eden . like < br > enough the scoundrel who wa start conflagr all over the < br > landscap would soon give hi attent to the belov farm with the < br > white cottag and

made ye so thin and melancholi , ” said < br > o ’ shea with a grin . “ clean yourself up and fill the old pipe with the < br > wick brand of cut plug that ye misnam tobacco , and we will sit down <

and stop to take sound at ten million < br > way-stat . where is the cook ? ” < br > < br > “ i ’ m the whole crew , ” repli johnni kent as he convoy hi guest < br > into the kitchen . “ you see , cap

, for thu they had pass mani an hour on bridg and < br > deck beneath the star . the tranquil of the place , the sens of < br > comfort and repos , sooth the restless temper of o ’ shea and turn < br

< br > blow it like a gentleman. ” < br > < br > “ and what would be the fun of that ? i have a charter in mind . would ye < br > like to hear of it ? ” < br > < br > the content farmer cock hi head alertli and stood in hi track . < br > the light in hi eye wa not inspir by hi neat row of beet , < br > carrot , and cabbag . o ’ shea perceiv that he wa curiou , and < br > hasten to add , in the most win accent : < br > < br > “ ’ ti the kind of a game you use to like , johnni . i have look over < br > the steamer , and she would pleas you . polit are stewin ’ in the < br > persian gulf and

to coax him away < br > from thi enchant place . he would hear what the blarney rascal had < br > to say and convinc him of hi folli . the shipmast like not the < br > stolid silenc of hi companion . he knew it of old for a stubborn < br > that noth could budg . howev , he went on with the argument : < br > < br > “ i need an engin , johnni . and will ye not take one more fling with < br > me ? you are an old rover , and thi mess about a farm will not < br > content you for long . ’ ti no place for a bold man that know hi < br > trade . wait a bit and come back here when ye have seen the

” < br > < br > “ it ain ’ t a mite hospit to treat you thi way , cap ’ n mike. ” < br > < br > “ pooh , man . ye do me a favor . ’ twould reconcil me to buy the next < br > farm if there wa a chanc of a ruction now and then. ” < br > < br > an hour later captain michael o ’ shea wa climb the long , easi slope < br > of the barn roof . one end of it support a water-tank built upon a < br > platform of stout timber . here the enterpris lookout found room < br > to sit and scrutin the surround wood and field . the sky wa < br > starlit but the dark had a duskier , more impenetr qualiti than < br > on a clear night at sea . o ’ shea ’ s keen vision , accustom to sweep < br > larg and lone horizon , wa rather baffl , but the power glass < br > enabl him to distinguish the vagu outlin of the woodland and < br > meadow and pastur boundari . < br > < br > in a blith humor he smile at the odd situat in which he found < br > himself . good old johnni kent had actual achiev a farm , and here < br > wa hi command perch on top of the barn like a weather-cock , and < br > enjoy it , forsooth . hi nimbl wit had frame the most effect < br > strategi possibl . it would be futil to go blunder through the < br > wood on a blind trail . from hi elev station he could see the < br > first spark of fire to glow in ani direct . the incendiari would < br > linger to make sure that the fire had fairli caught , and o ’ shea hope < br > to catch him unawar and overpow him . < br > < br > the silent hour wore on and drew near to midnight when he had < br > promis to arous johnni kent . noth suspici had been descri . < br > a whippoorwil sound it call with such breathless , unflag < br > persist that the sentinel amus himself count the sweet , < br > monoton note and conclud that a vast deal of energi wa go to < br > wast . < br > < br > “ that bird is over-engin for it tonnag , ” he reflect . “ well , i < br > have stood me watch in wors place than thi . ’ ti a shame to turn < br > poor old johnni out of hi bunk . i will stay up here awhil and listen < br > to the long-wind bird and enjoy the pleasur of me own company. ” < br > < br > hi back against the water-tank , he could not walk to ward off the < br > drowsi that wa born on the wing of the soft night wind all < br > laden with the smell of tree and earth and hay-field . hi vigil < br > relax and hi thought drift away to other clime and place . < br > < br > he came out of hi reveri with a sudden start , convinc that he had < br > been caught nap , for hi eye had fail to detect anyth move < br > in the direct of the barn . but he could hear some one grope about < br > close to the side of the build . a stick snap , the bush rustl , < br > and there were other sound veri small yet signific . captain michael < br > o ’ shea gingerli forsook the littl platform and began to slide down the < br > roof , fairli dig hi finger and toe into the shingl with the < br > tenac of a cat . < br > < br > the overhang eav made it difficult to observ what wa go < br > on below . in order to peep over the edg of the roof , the shipmast < br > wa compel to sprawl upon hi stomach with hi heel higher than < br > hi head and with no purchas by which to maintain hi grip . it wa < br > a wide-angl roof or he would have toboggan off into space befor < br > hi labori descent carri him as far as the eav . howev , in hi < br > trade a man who could not hang on by hi eyelid wa a lubber of a < br > sailor , and the bold o ’ shea wriggl into posit an inch at a time . < br > < br > the mysteri nois might have been made by johnni kent prowl in < br > search of him , but o ’ shea wa afraid to call out lest he might frighten < br > away the object of hi vigil . hi trouser catch on a nail and < br > hold him fast for a moment , he ceas hi precari exert long < br > enough to listen . thi time hi ear caught the crackl of crumpl < br > paper and a success of sharper nois as if some one were break < br > dri wood over hi knee . he smelt the unmistak odor of kerosen . < br > almost directli beneath him , and not more than a dozen feet distant , an < br > attempt wa well under way to set fire to johnni kent ’ s barn . < br > < br > with more speed and less caution o ’ shea manag to poke hi head over < br > the edg of the roof , intend to get hi bear befor launch < br > the attack . he found himself directli abov a shadowi figur which < br > flit to the wood-pil and back again with quick , furtiv movement . < br > captain o ’ shea had never found himself in a more embarrass < br > situat . he dislik the idea of let go and dive head first , < br > which wa the quickest method of come to close quarter . and even if < br > he should tri to turn about and launch himself right end to , he wa < br > like to hit the earth with the deuc and all of a thump and perhap < br > break hi leg on a stick of cord-wood . the ladder by which he had < br > climb to the roof wa on the other side of the build and he had no < br > time to scrambl in search of it . < br > < br > while he hesit the man beneath him scratch a match . startl and < br > flurri at sight of thi immin danger , o ’ shea let hi grip loosen < br > for an instant and the law of graviti solv the problem for him . with < br > a blood-curdl yell he slid over the brink , hi finger claw < br > wildli at the shingl and the wooden gutter . head downward he plung < br > and by right should have broken hi neck . hi own theori to explain < br > hi surviv wa that an irishman alway alight on hi feet . the fact < br > wa that the incendiari stranger happen to be in a stoop postur < br > and o ’ shea ’ s head smote him squar between the shoulder . < br > < br > both men roll over and over like shot rabbit . there follow an < br > interv dure which the one took no thought of hostil , and the < br > other had no interest in flight . o ’ shea sat up at length , grunt onc < br > or twice , and rub hi head in a daze manner . the pile of kindl < br > had been scatter , but a fragment of newspap wa burn and he < br > brought hi heel down on it . hi quarri now began to realiz that hi < br > back wa not broken and he show sign of life . the pair sat glare < br > at each other , speechless , endeavor to regain the wind that had been < br > knock out of them . < br > < br > as tough as sole-leath wa captain o ’ shea , and not to be put out < br > of commiss by so trifl a mishap as thi . hi head wa spin < br > like a top and he felt sick and weak , but he had a job on hand and he < br > meant to finish it . the revolv wa miss from hi pocket . it had < br > been dislodg by hi tumbl and it wa useless to grope for it in < br > the dark . by now the other man had found hi feet and wa move < br > unsteadili toward the end of the barn . o ’ shea made for him and they < br > clinch in a clump of burdock . < br > < br > neither wa in the best of condit to make a homer combat of < br > it . to o ’ shea ’ s dismay he discov that he had caught a tartar as < br > collision-proof as himself . he tri to grip the fellow by the throat < br > and to throw him with a heav and a twist , but a pair of arm as < br > muscular as hi own flail him in the face and hammer hi rib . < br > then the brawni young shipmast let fli with hi fist and broke hi < br > knuckl against a jaw which seem to be made of oak . < br > < br > “ if the both of us wa ship-shap we would make a grand fight of it , ” < br > pant o ’ shea with the shadow of a grin . “ ’ ti no time for etiquett < br > and i will stretch him befor he doe the same for me. ” < br > < br > “ wait till i set my teeth in you , ” growl hi adversari , find < br > speech for the first time . “ i ’ ll tear your windpip out , ” and he < br > follow the horrid threat with a string of oath that chill < br > o ’ shea ’ s blood , although he had heard profan over all the seven < br > sea . the accent were so hoars and savag as to be even more alarm < br > than the word . the shipmast ceas to regard the fight in the light < br > of a divers . he wa convinc that he had a madman to deal with . < br > keep clear , he turn and made for the wood-pil , a few yard < br > distant . grope for a moment , he wa fortun enough to catch up a < br > four-foot length of hickori sapl , as handi a bludgeon as he could < br > desir . < br > < br > as if at bay , the other man made no effort to escap dure thi < br > respit , but lung after o ’ shea , who wheel in the nick of time and < br > found room to swing hi hickori club . it rose and fell onli onc . the < br > madman toppl over and collaps among the burdock . < br > < br > “ he will stay there for a while , ” said the weari o ’ shea . “ i caught him < br > fair over the ear , and ’ ti a safe bet that i put a dent in him. ” < br > < br > thereupon he turn hi lag footstep in the direct of the < br > cottag . a lantern came bob out of the wood-sh door , and it < br > light reveal the larg presenc of johnni kent simpli clad in a < br > flow night-shirt and a pair of slipper . at discern o ’ shea < br > advanc through the gloom , he shout : < br > < br > “ whi didn ’ t you wake me up at eight bell ? i just come to and turn < br > out to look for you , cap ’ n mike . all quiet , i suppos ? ” < br > < br > “ ye . i made it quiet , you sleepi old terrapin , ” return o ’ shea with a < br > laugh befor they had come togeth . “ didn ’ t you hear me yell when i < br > fell off the barn roof ? ” < br > < br > “ nari a yell . i do sleep sounder than when i wa at sea , ” and johnni < br > kent waddl nearer and held the lantern higher . “ graciou saint , what < br > have you been doin ’ to yourself ? your nose is all bloodi up and one < br > eye is bung . what do you mean by fall off my barn roof ? you must < br > have tap that barrel of hard cider in the cellar. ” < br > < br > “ i tap a harder custom than that , johnni . it wa a gorgeou shindi < br > while it last , but i had to wind it up . i caught your firebug and i < br > laid him out in the barn-yard . ye can hold a wake over him or send for < br > the police. ” < br > < br > the engin swung hi lantern in excit circl as he pranc toward < br > the barn , unmind of the chilli breez that play about hi bare < br > shank . < br > < br > “ you ’ re not jokin ’ , are you , cap ’ n mike ? the situat is too blame < br > seriou for that . you land him , honest ? you ’ re the man to turn the < br > trick . where did you ketch him ? ” < br > < br > “ i got the drop on him , as ye might say , and it wa a divil of a drop . < br > my neck is an inch shorter than it wa , but me collis bulkhead held < br > fast . he is a broth of a boy , and he will be hard to hold when he come < br > out of the tranc i put him in. ” < br > < br > “ and i miss the fun , ” mourn johnni . “ i ’ m sure get old , cap ’ n < br > mike . but i guess we can handl him without send for the villag < br > constabl to-night. ” < br > < br > “ i have seen you tame some pretti tough tarrier . thi is a bad one < br > and no mistak . fetch the lantern closer and we will look him over. ” < br > < br > they plough through the burdock , the prickli burr caus johnni < br > kent to stride high and wide . the stranger lay as he had fallen . the < br > light reveal him as a power built man of middl age with reddish < br > hair and a stubbl growth of beard . the dilapid shirt and trouser < br > were stain with earth and grass , and held togeth by a leather belt . < br > hi captor were about to scrutin him more close when he open < br > hi eye , groan , and rais himself upon hi elbow with an unexpect < br > display of vital . bid johnni kent stand by with the lantern , < br > o ’ shea caught up the hickori club and flourish it as a hint that < br > uncondit surrend wa advis . < br > < br > the prison blink stupidli at the lantern and made no effort to < br > rise . hi aspect wa not in the least feroci . o ’ shea could scarc < br > believ that thi wa the madman who had threaten to sink hi teeth < br > in him and discommod hi windpip . rough-featur he wa and unkempt < br > beyond word , but he convey a most incongru impress of kindli < br > and harmless simplic , and o ’ shea wa the more amaz to hear him < br > mutter in hi hoars , curious thicken accent : < br > < br > “ can you spare a chew of tobacco , shipmat ? ” < br > < br > “ well , i ’ ll be jigger , ” exclaim johnni kent , absent feel for < br > hi trouser ’ pocket which were not there . “ you certainli did tame him < br > a whole lot , cap ’ n mike. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti a riddl i can not fathom at all , ” wa the repli . < br > < br > indign got the upper hand of the engin ’ s gener impuls and < br > he explos demand of the stranger : < br > < br > “ what do you mean by tryin ’ to set fire to my barn , you addle-head , < br > misbegotten , murder son of a sculpin ? i wish cap ’ n mike had knock < br > the block clean off you. ” < br > < br > the queer visitor show no resent , but smile in an amiabl sort < br > of fashion and rub a larg , red welt just abov hi right ear . never < br > a word did he say , although the twain pli him with question . hi < br > demeanor wa as friendli as if they had done him some signal servic . < br > < br > “ if you can ’ t talk , mayb ye can walk , ” gustili shout o ’ shea . “ we < br > will clap ye under hatch for to-night and investig by daylight . we < br > have caught an odd fish thi time , johnny. ” < br > < br > “ prod him into the wood-sh and lock him up , ” grumbl the other . < br > “ he ’ s plumb twistifi in hi mental work , and i can ’ t make head or < br > tail of him. ” < br > < br > at a beckon gestur the prison meekli tri to get on hi feet , < br > but he had been shorn of hi strength and he fell twice befor o ’ shea < br > and johnni kent grasp him by the arm and steer him in the path < br > that led to the cottag . he stumbl along like a drunken man and had < br > to be half-drag over the low step at the wood-sh door . call < br > himself a soft-heart old fool , the engin bustl into the hous < br > and drag forth a spare mattress . o ’ shea obtain a lamp in the < br > kitchen , also cold water and a towel to bath the hurt that hi hickori < br > weapon had inflict . < br > < br > the red-hair man sat forlornli upon the mattress , lean against the < br > coal-bin , hi hand clasp over hi knee . he had the dumb , wist < br > look of a beaten dog , and hi eye , remark blue of color , follow < br > captain o ’ shea with no ill-wil , but like one who recogn hi < br > master . it wa clear enough that he wa to be dealt with as a man with < br > a disord mind , and it wa unmanli to hold him account for hi < br > arson and violenc . attack unawar in the dark , there had been < br > provoc for hi bestial outbreak , and it wa to be conclud that < br > hi usual mood wa harmless , except a fatal fond for play < br > with fire . < br > < br > “ i have a strong notion that he is a seafarin ’ man , ” said o ’ shea , as he < br > gave the captiv a stiff drink of whiskey from the bottl kept in the < br > hall cupboard . “ mayb thi will buck him up and set hi tongu go . < br > that ’ s a sailor ’ s belt he ha on , johnni . and he ha the look of it. ” < br > < br > the engin had put hi spectacl on hi nose and wa examin the < br > litter of small object he had fish out of the man ’ s pocket . one of < br > them wa like a leather thong thicken in the middl , and he cri < br > excitedli : < br > < br > “ you ’ re right , cap ’ n mike . here ’ s a sailor ’ s palm -- a sea thimbl , and < br > the cuss ha mend hi cloth with it . see the patch on hi shirt , < br > and he ha stitch the hole in hi shoe with bit of tar twine. ” < br > < br > “ he call me shipmat when he ask for a chew , but mani a landlubb < br > use the word and i did not lay much store by it. ” < br > < br > “ it ’ s onli twenti mile to the main coast , ” said johnni kent , “ and he < br > may have wander inland from one of the ports. ” < br > < br > “ i have a hunch that he didn ’ t come out of a coast schooner . the < br > beggar ha sail deep water in hi time . i wonder if he is hungri . < br > better introduc him to some grub . he is round to , but he ha about < br > as much convers in him as an oyster. ” < br > < br > the engin rummag in the kitchen and brought out a plate of < br > biscuit , cold bacon , potato , and pickl , which the red-hair man < br > ate with an avid that betoken starvat . the sight move johnni < br > kent almost to tear . the last spark of hi animos wa quench . < br > there wa no more aw fate than to be separ from three squar < br > meal per day . < br > < br > “ we ’ ll swab the dirt off him and shuck those rag , rotten cloth < br > befor we batten him down for the night , ” said johnni . “ i can ’ t leav a < br > sailor in thi fix , even if he is flighti in the main-top and ha tri < br > to smoke out the whole darn neighborhood. ” < br > < br > while he depart in search of a shift of raiment , captain o ’ shea < br > remov the man ’ s shirt . at the first tug it tore and came away in hi < br > hand . the prison had remain sit in the same postur , but now < br > he move and lazili stretch hi length upon the mattress , lie on < br > hi stomach , hi face pillow against hi arm . hi hunger satisfi , < br > the desir of sleep had overtaken him , and hi heavi breath told < br > o ’ shea that the extraordinari guest had carri hi riddl to dreamland . < br > < br > johnni kent had taken the lamp into the hous , and the lantern which < br > had been left stand on the floor cast a long , duski shadow athwart < br > the recumb figur . the shipmast stood look down at the massiv < br > shoulder and knot , hairi arm of the stranger when hi attent < br > wa fix by someth which caus him to stare as though startl < br > and fascin and perplex . the man ’ s broad back bore some kind of a < br > design , an uncouth , sprawl pattern such as no artist in tattoo < br > could ever have trace to pleas a sailor ’ s fanci . < br > < br > it wa a huge disfigur compos of bold line and angl which < br > stood out in black project against the white skin . even in the dim < br > light , captain o ’ shea could discern that these rude mark had been < br > done with a purpos , that they compos themselv into a symbol of < br > some sort . they look as if they had been laid on with a brush , in < br > broad , sweep stroke which ran the width of the back , and all the < br > way down to the waist . the man could not have made them himself . they < br > were mysteri , sinist . < br > < br > o ’ shea wa neither timid nor apt to be caught off hi guard , but < br > hi puls flutter and hi mouth felt dri . he wa in the presenc < br > of someth wholli beyond hi ken , baffl hi experi . thi < br > red-hair derelict , whose wit had forsaken him , brought a messag < br > hostil , alien , and remot . present o ’ shea bethought himself of < br > the lantern and made for it with nervou hast . hold it close to < br > the back of the sleep man , he stare with horrifi attent and < br > piti wrath that a human be should have been so maltreat . < br > < br > the great symbol or design had been slash in the flesh with stroke < br > of a sword or knife . the edg of the scar stood out in rough ridg . < br > into the wound had been rub india-ink or some like substanc which < br > the process of heal held indel fix . the pattern thu made < br > perman and conspicu wa that of a charact of the chines or < br > japanes languag . < br > < br > johnni kent came out of the kitchen and beckon him . the engin < br > stood open-mouth and gaze down at the tremend ideograph that had < br > been so brutal hack in human flesh . o ’ shea had noth to say . < br > what wa there to say ? the thing wa there . it spoke for itself . what < br > it meant wa an enigma which neither man could in the smallest degre < br > attempt to unravel . when johnni kent spoke it wa onli to voic the < br > obviou fact or two that requir no explan . < br > < br > “ he wa chop and brand proper , wasn ’ t he , cap ’ n mike ? and it wa < br > done for some devilish purpos . i ’ ve knock about most of the port in < br > the orient , but i never heard of anyth like this. ” < br > < br > “ they made a document of him , johnni . ’ ti chines workmanship , i ’ m < br > think . how could a man live through a thing like that ? for the love < br > of heaven , look at those scar ! they are as wide as me thumb , and some < br > of them are better than a foot long . and they stand out so black and < br > wick that it give me the creeps. ” < br > < br > “ it mean someth , cap ’ n mike . and it ’ s up to us to find the answer . < br > one of them chines charact may tell a whole lot . their heathen < br > fashion of slingin ’ a pen is more like drawin ’ pictur . a few line < br > and a coupl of wriggl all bunch up togeth and it tell the < br > story. ” < br > < br > “ and what is thi stori , johnni ? answer me that. ” < br > < br > “ you can search me . it ’ s almighti queer busi to happen on my < br > peac farm in the state o ’ maine. ” < br > < br > “ let the poor beggar rest here till morn and then we will consid < br > him some more . i guess we don ’ t want to turn him over to the constabl , < br > johnny. ” < br > < br > “ not till we tri our hand at translatin ’ him . i wish i had a chines < br

like harborin ’ a stormi < br > petrel. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti not fair to blackguard me , ” laugh o ’ shea . “ you and your < br > neighbor can sleep easi in your bed for i have caught the bogie-man. ” < br > < br > “ i wish i knew what it is you ’ ve caught , ” sigh the engin . < br > < br > o ’ shea bent over the sleep man in order to rais hi head and slip < br > underneath it a roll blanket to serv as a pillow . hi finger < br > chanc to detect on the top of the skull a curiou depress or < br > groov over which the red hair wa rumpl in a sort of cow-lick . < br > examin convinc him that thi wa the result of some violent blow < br > which had fairli dent the boni structur and press it down upon the < br > brain . < br > < br > “ that is where he got it , ” said o ’ shea . “ and ’ ti what made a lunat < br > of him. ” < br > < br > “ it look like they tri to kill him with an axe but he wa too tough < br > for ’ em , cap ’ n mike . no wonder that crack you gave him over the ear < br > didn ’ t bother him much. ” < br > < br > “ and whoever it wa that put their mark on hi back wa the same parti < br > who cave in hi lid or i ’ m a liar , ” wa the conclus of michael < br > o ’ shea . < br > < br > < br > ii < br > < br > the onli inmat of the cottag who slept soundli wa the vagabond in < br > the wood-sh . hi guardian stood watch and watch as a matter of < br > habit , but the earli morn found them both astir and drink mug < br > of coffe veri hot and strong . their guest had not move from hi < br > outstretch posit on the mattress . he slumber like a man drug < br > or utterli exhaust . o ’ shea had spread a blanket over hi nake back < br > and shoulder partli for warmth , but anoth motiv also prompt him . < br > he wish to hide the cruel disfigur . it seem unfeel to < br > expos it . < br > < br > now by daylight he move on tipto to the mattress and twitch the < br > blanket asid . o ’ shea had live among hard men and fought hi way < br > through batter circumst in which physic brutal still < br > surviv to uphold the rude old tradit of the sea . but thi sight < br > made him winc and shiver , and he did not like to look at it . cover < br > it with the blanket he fell to wonder , with an intens of interest < br > that grip him more and more strongli , what tragedi wa conceal < br > behind the curtain of thi luckless man ’ s past . < br > < br > johnni kent had agre that he must be harbor in the cottag for < br > the present . their surmis that he wa a seafar made it seem a duti < br > to befriend him by all mean in their power . to spread the tide in < br > the villag that the pyromaniac had been caught would arous a storm < br > of anger and resent . amid much clamor and disord he would be < br > handcuf and tie with rope and triumphantli lug to the counti < br > jail . the farmer were in no mood to condon hi misde on the score < br > of mental irrespons . on the other hand , kindli treatment and < br > associ with those accustom to follow the sea might awaken hi < br > dormant intellig and prompt him to reveal someth of hi shroud < br > histori . < br > < br > “ it ’ s an awkward proposit , ” sigh johnni kent , “ but we ’ ll have to < br > work it out somehow . of cours i ’ m sorri for the poor lunat that < br > ha been man-handl so abomin , and so long as we don ’ t give him < br > match to play with i guess he ’ s safe to have around . but how can i < br > keep him hid from my neighbor ? they ’ re as gossipi and curiou as a < br > hogshead of cats. ” < br > < br > “ i mean to find out who brand him and whi , ” wa the vehement < br > assert of captain o ’ shea . < br > < br > shortli after thi the stalwart waif in the wood-sh awaken and < br > hi captor were pleas to note that he wa still tractabl . inde , < br > he greet them with hi confid , good-natur grin and sat pull < br > on hi shoe . to their word of greet , howev , he made no repli . < br > appar the plaintiv request for a chew of tobacco had been the end < br > of hi convers . < br > < br > “ he use up all the languag in hi system , ” comment o ’ shea . “ mayb < br > he will not burst into speech again unless i hit him anoth crack over <

it wouldn ’ t do to trust him with a razor , cap ’ n mike , ” said the < br > engin . < br > < br > “ pooh ! fetch me the tackl and i will shave him meself . it will make < br > him look saner anyhow and i want to see what he is like. ” < br > < br > the guest seem delight with thi thought attent and submit < br > to a dose of lather with all the good grace in the world . bath , < br > shave , clad in one of johnni kent ’ s white suit , he wa astonishingli < br > transform . a strap big man he wa , and he held himself with < br > the easi pois of one whose muscl had been train by hard work on < br > roll deck . stroll into the kitchen , he pass through it and < br > enter the other room , hi guardian follow to see what he might < br > do . < br > < br > at sight of the scrub floor , the polish brasswork , the baromet < br > on the wall , and the simpl furnish so like the cabin of a ship , < br > hi blue eye show a flicker of interest and he paus and absent < br > shove an inkstand back from the shelf of a desk lest it slide off . < br > the trick wa so signific of hi call that o ’ shea need no more < br > proof . a tin box fill with match caught hi glanc and he instantli < br > made for them . hi demeanor wa furtiv and cun . he had becom a < br > differ man in a twinkl . < br > < br > johnni kent jump for him and o ’ shea wa at hi elbow readi for a < br > tussl . but he permit the match to be taken from him without < br > resist , and forgot all about them in finger the splice hammock < br > rope on the porch . a gestur from o ’ shea and he return to the < br > kitchen and took the chair assign him for breakfast . the prudent < br > engin kept an eye on the knife and fork which the stranger use with < br > the manner rather of the cabin than the forecastl . o ’ shea studi < br > the rug , honest featur of thi red-head mysteri and earnestli < br > expound variou theori that wander into blind alley and led < br > nowher at all . the onli conjectur which seem to hang togeth wa < br > that , in some way or anoth , the man ’ s propens for set fire < br > hark back to the time and scene of the terribl blow over the head < br > which had benumb hi memori and jar hi wit . befor thi disast < br > overtook him he must have been a fellow readi and courag , abl to < br > hold hi own in the rough-and-tumbl world . < br > < br > “ what shall we call him ? it ’ ll be handi to give him some kind of a < br > name , ” suggest johnni kent . < br > < br > “ he remind me of big bill maguir , that wa mate of the _sea bird_ < br > bark , and fell through a hatch and broke hi neck when he came aboard < br > drunk at valparaiso . he wa a rare seaman when sober. ” < br > < br > “ let ’ s call him bill maguir , then , cap ’ n mike . he like us and i guess < br > he intend to sign on with us and hang around. ” < br > < br > “ whi don ’ t you tri set him to work , johnni ? he would make a jewel < br > of a hire man. ” < br > < br > “ ye . on a fire-proof farm that wa insur for all the underwrit < br > would stand for , ” dubious return the engin . “ i can ’ t watch him < br > everi minute. ” < br > < br > captain michael o ’ shea bang the tabl with hi fist and decis < br > exclaim : < br > < br > “ ’ ti in my mind to visit you a day or two longer , johnni . curios < br > is fair consum me . i can see the ugli , wick mark on thi poor < br > beggar ’ s back whenev i shut me eye . it haunt me like a nightmar < br > that is too monstrou to talk about. ” < br > < br > “ i ’ d give a thousand dollar to fathom it , ” roar johnni kent . “ and < br > bill maguir just sit across the tabl and grin like a wooden < br > figger-head. ” < br > < br > “ i suppos ye have no chinamen in your villag , ” ventur o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ nari a chink . i ’ ll bet the children never saw one. ” < br > < br > “ and where could we find the nearest one , johnni ? ’ ti our busi < br > to dig up a cock-ey lad that will impart to us the mean of the < br > messag that wa carv into the back of bill maguir . nor will i know < br > an easi minut till we have the information. ” < br > < br > johnni ponder a littl and then spoke up with sudden hope : < br > < br > “ onc in a while i ’ m so sagaci that i surpris myself . the chines < br > ambassador spend hi summer on the coast at poplar cove . it ’ s no more < br > than an hour from here by train . he ’ s a fat , sociabl old parti , so < br > they tell me . and where could you find a better man to solv the riddl < br > of bill maguir ? ” < br > < br > “ you score a bull ’ s-ey , ” cri o ’ shea . “ and he will have secretari < br > and such , and we will let them all have a tri at it. ” < br > < br > “ but how will you show ’ em bill ’ s back ? draw it on paper , or get a < br > photograph made ? ” < br > < br > “ nonsens ! bill will take hi back along with us . we will produc the < br > origin human document. ” < br > < br > the engin wa inclin to object to thi , but the edict of captain < br > o ’ shea were to be obey , and to argu wa to wast word . the perkin < br > boy wa summon from the barn and instruct , by mean of thunder < br > inton , to stand guard over the farm at peril of hi life . he < br > spent hi night at hi own home and had miss the excit of the < br > captur of bill maguir , wherefor the secret wa safe hid from hi < br > inquisit eye and ear . he gaze at the robust , silent stranger < br > with rampant curios , but learn noth beyond the fact that hi < br > employ propos to be absent for the day with hi two guest . < br > < br > the young perkin drove them to the railroad station in the two-seat < br > democrat wagon , johnni kent sit at hi side and smother hi < br > question . the ticklish busi of convey bill maguir through the < br > villag wa accomplish without the slightest mishap . he behav with < br > flawless digniti and seem content with the societi of hi escort . < br > dure the brief journey by train to poplar cove he slouch in hi < br > seat as if half-asleep until the railroad swung across a wide belt of < br > salt marsh and turn in a northerli direct to follow the coast . < br > there were glimps of rocki headland fring with surf , of wood < br > inlet and white beach , and now and then a patch of blue ocean and a < br > far-dist sky-lin . < br > < br > the red-hair man from nowher wa mightili move by the smell and < br > sight of the sea . hi heavi , listless manner vanish . hi rug face < br > becam more intellig , more alert . it reflect tide of emot , < br > poignant and profound . it wa pain to watch him as he scowl and < br > chew hi lip or brush away tear that came brim to hi eye . < br > it wa evid that he struggl with memori and associ that < br > came and fled like torment ghost befor he could lay hold of them . < br > again , for a moment , he broke the bond of hi dumb , and loudli < br > utter the word : < br > < br > “ make for the boat . don ’ t mind me . the swine have done for me. ” < br > < br > to o ’ shea and johnni kent the word were like a flash of lightn < br > against the black background of night . they reveal the man for < br > what he had been in hi prime , in the full statur of heroic < br > self-abneg , think of other and not of himself even in the last < br > extrem . they understood thi kind of manhood . it squar with their < br > own creed . aglow with sympathi , they pli the derelict with eager < br > question , but he onli mutter , wearili shook hi head , and turn < br > away to gaze at the sea . < br > < br > at the poplar cove station they hire a carriag and were driven < br > along the cliff road to the pretenti summer-plac occupi by < br > hi excel hao su ting and hi silk-rob retinu . to escort a < br > crazi sailor into the august presenc of the distinguish diplomat , <

qualiti of < br > courag that is not afraid of ridicul . < br > < br > as for captain o ’ shea , he wa in a wick temper , and it would fare < br > ill with the man that laugh at him . hi smoulder indign at < br > the barbar inflict upon the seaman had been just now kindl by < br > the word which leap so vividli out of the cloud past and were < br > wing with so much signific . “ bill maguir ” had unflinchingli < br > play the card as the fate dealt them and had paid a price as bitter < br > as death . the game wa unfinish , the account had not been settl . < br > at thi moment o ’ shea detest the entir chines race and would have < br > gladli choke the ambassador in a bight of hi own pigtail . < br > < br > the trio walk slowli across the wide lawn and drew near to the < br > rambl white hous of a coloni design to which the chines < br > dignitari had transfer hi exot household . it wa for o ’ shea to < br > explain the fantast errand and gain admitt , wherefor he prepar < br > to dissembl hi hostil emot and make use of that tact and suaviti < br > which had carri him over mani rough place . < br > < br > ala for hi plan of campaign ! it wa overturn in a twinkl . the < br > red-hair sailor follow obedi to the pillar portico which < br > frame the entranc of the hous . o ’ shea rang the bell , and hi quick < br > ear detect the soft shuffl of felt-sol shoe . the door wa swung < br > open and there confront them a chines servant in the dress of < br > hi countri . at sight of the shaven head , the immobil , ivory-hu < br > counten , and the flow garment of white and blue , the dement < br > sailor becam instantli enrag . < br > < br > snarl , he leap forward with clinch fist and hi face wa < br > black with hatr . the wari o ’ shea wa too quick for him and manag < br > to thrust him to one side so that hi rush collid with the case of < br > the door . the frighten servant squeal and scuttl back into the < br > hous . instead of tri to pursu him , the red-hair man wa taken < br > with a violent fit of trembl , seemingli compound of weak and < br > terror . befor o ’ shea and johnni kent could collect their wit in thi < br > extrem awkward situat , he wheel about , dash between them , and < br > made for the lawn as if the devil were at hi heel . < br > < br > o ’ shea wa after him like a shot , the engin puf along in the < br > wake of the chase . the servant ’ s outcri had alarm the household . < br > out of the front-door came spill a surpris number of sleek < br > attaché , secretari , domest , and what not . behind them waddl at < br > a gait more leisur none other than hi excel hao su ting in all < br > the gorgeou amplitud of hi mandarin ’ s garb . in a chatter group < br > they paus to watch poor bill maguir flee with tremend stride < br > in the direct of the roadway , the activ figur of captain o ’ shea < br > steadili gain on him . far in the rear labor the mighti bulk of < br > johnni kent . < br > < br > the fugit wa not in the best of trim for a sustain effort , and he < br > tire rapidli , sway from side to side as he ran . near the outermost < br > boundari of the ambassador ’ s ground , o ’ shea wa abl to overtak and < br > trip him . maguir fell headlong , plough up the turf , and wa so < br > daze and breathless that o ’ shea wa kneel upon him and shove a < br > revolv in hi face befor he could pull himself togeth . then johnni < br > kent came up , and between them they subdu the man ’ s struggl to < br > renew hi flight . < br > < br > he made no effort to harm either of them . hi befog mind seem < br

madman < br > had broken away from hi keeper and possibl had sought the place to < br > harm hi excel . poor maguir groan piti and renew hi < br > exert to releas himself , but the weight of two uncommonli strong < br > men pinion him to the sod . at a word from the ambassador sever of < br > hi retinu hasten to sit upon the captiv ’ s arm and leg . a dapper < br > young secretari act as spokesman and inquir in precis , cultiv < br > english : < br > < br > “ may i troubl you to inform hi excel whi you make all thi < br > commot on hi premis ? it is an insan person , or perhap a < br

prostrat < br > maguir . “ he ha behav himself veri well till now , but he is impolit < br > enough to dislik the chinese. ” < br > < br > “ he is not correct in the intellect ? then whi have you brought him < br > here ? ” ask the secretari . < br > < br > “ to show him to hi excel , ” quoth o ’ shea . “ ’ ti inform we < br > seek , and the man himself is the document in the case. ” < br > < br > “ he turn obstreper most unexpect and sudden , ” anxious put in < br > johnni kent , “ and now it ’ s blame unhandi to show him to you . i ’ m kind < br > of stump . what about it , cap ’ n mike ? ” < br > < br > the secretari might have look puzzl had he belong to ani other < br > race , but hi face remain polit and inscrut as he smoothli < br > protest : < br > < br > “ your explan is not clear . i advis you to remov all yourselv < br > from the premis of hi excel . he ha no interest in you. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea wa oblivi of the absurd tableau in which he play the < br > lead rôle . the red-hair sailor wa still stretch upon the grass , < br > and hi brace of stanch friend held him at anchor . he wa quieter and < br > the tempest of passion had pass . the chines servant who had been < br > roost on the outli part of hi frame withdrew from the scene of < br > war and rejoin their comrad . as soon as they were beyond the rang < br > of hi vision , maguir subsid and seem as docil as of yore . < br > < br > hi excel hao su ting show hi august back to the turbul < br > intrud and pace slowli toward the hous . sever of the parti < br > turn to follow him , but the secretari aforesaid , togeth with a few < br > of the staff , tarri in order to be sure that the trio of invad < br > left the place . captain michael o ’ shea wa not to be thwart by the < br > disadvantag situat in which he found himself . hustl maguir < br > to hi feet , he tri to drive it into him with strong word and < br > mean gestur that he must be obedi and no harm would come to < br > him . the revolv wa an eloqu argument in itself . < br > < br > sensibl johnni kent turn the sailor about so that he could see < br > noth of the chines and wa face the cliff and the sea . in thi < br > posit the engin held him , while o ’ shea , seiz the opportun < br > moment , fairli rip the coat off the man and pull up hi shirt < br > to bare hi back . it wa dramat done and the effect wa < br > instantan . not a word wa said in explan . none wa need . the < br > great chines charact that spread between the man ’ s shoulder-blad < br > and down to hi waist , show black and scar and livid . < br > < br > the secretari and the other orient stood gaze at it without move < br > so much as a finger . they said noth , but one heard their breath come < br > quick . a kind of whistl sigh escap the dapper secretari , and hi < br > eye glitter like two button of jet . he wa strive to maintain a < br > composur which had been rack to the foundat . hi blood wa of < br > a finer strain than that of the underl who stood near him , and he < br > held hi ground while they began to edg away in retreat . present one < br > of them broke into a run . the other took to their heel in a panic < br > rout and scamper toward the hous , their baggi breech flutter , < br > queue whip the wind , felt shoe fairli twinkl . from one of them < br > came back a shrill , wail , “ ai oh. ” < br > < br > they race past hi excel hao su ting , who stood aghast at the < br > gross disregard of etiquett and vainli command them to halt . nor did < br > the mad pace slacken until the last of them had dive to cover . o ’ shea < br > forgot hi busi and grin with honest enjoy , but the face of < br > the secretari , now haggard and parchment-lik , recal him to the task < br > in hand . thi lone chines who had withstood the desir to run away wa < br > move nearer to examin the brand back of the red-hair sailor . < br > < br > “ ye have all the mark of a man that is sick to the soul with fear , ” < br > grimli observ o ’ shea , “ but you are too brave to give up to it , and i < br > admir ye for it . tell me , have you ever seen a man scar like that < br > befor ? ” < br > < br > the secretari spoke with a visibl effort , and hi voic had the < br > rasp edg of intens excit . < br > < br > “ ye , i have seen that charact , symbol , whatev you will call it -- in < br > my own countri . it is most shock , amaz , to behold it in thi way , < br > inflict upon an american. ” < br > < br > “ do you need to look at it ani longer ? can ye rememb it ? will i show < br > it to hi excel ? ” demand o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ i can not forget it , ” slowli repli the other . “ no , it is not < br > necessari to show it to the ambassador . i assur you it is not < br > necessari . i shall inform him that i have seen it . he will know what it < br > is . i wish veri much that it may not be seen by hi illustri self. ” < br > < br > the word and manner of the secretari convey the weightiest < br > earnest . he wa in an agoni of dread lest hao su ting should return < br > and view the spectacl of the brand man . o ’ shea piti hi distress < br > and wa shrewd enough to perceiv that noth would be gain by < br > oppos him . maguir wa restless , and johnni kent had troubl in < br > stick fast to him . < br > < br > “ walk him along toward the railroad station , ” said o ’ shea to hi < br > comrad . “ he will give you no bother onc he make hi of and goe < br > clear of thi chines coloni . here ’ s the gun , if ye need to persuad < br > him a bit . wait for me there , johnni . thi young

you throw up < br > signal rockets. ” < br > < br > with thi repli , which betoken excel disciplin , the engin < br > grasp the sailor-man by the arm , and march him into the road . < br > o ’ shea and the secretari were about to resum their convers when < br > the latter ’ s attent wa caught by the beckon gestur of the < br > chines ambassador , who seem impati . < br > < br > “ hi excel wish to ask me whi there wa so much unseemli < br > excit by hi servant , ” said the young man . “ i would prefer first < br > to talk with you , but hi command must be obey . your name ? thank < br > you . i shall have the pleasur of acquaint captain o ’ shea with the < br > ambassador of china to the unit states. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti no pleasur for ani one concern , to judg by the symptom , ” < br

unfortun friend. ” < br > < br > “ mayb the ambassador could see it from where he stood , ” suggest < br > o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ no . hi eye are not of the best without spectacl . he is not a young < br > man and hi health is inferior . to shock him by the sight of someth < br > dread to see might have unhappi consequences. ” < br > < br > “ but what is the answer ? whi wa everi man of you bowl off hi feet ? ” < br > exclaim o ’ shea . “ ’ ti not the way of your peopl to be afraid of < br > scar and wound . ye deal out some pretti tough punish to your < br > criminals. ” < br > < br > “ it is advis that you should pay your respect to hi excel , ” < br > evas return the chines . < br > < br > the ambassador regard captain o ’ shea with an unfriendli stare until < br > the secretari , with mani low bow , held rapid convers with the < br > personag in hi own languag . the elderli statesman and diplomat < br > grunt incredul , shook hi head in vehement contradict , and < br > o ’ shea conjectur that he wa roundli scold the young man for < br > bring him such an imposs yarn . at length he yield with a frown < br > of annoy and briefli address the shipmast . < br > < br > “ i speak not much english . come into my hous , please. ” < br > < br > he preced them into a larg librari with mani long window screen < br > by bamboo shade . pass through thi , he enter a smaller room < br > more conveni for privaci . the threshold wa a boundari between the < br > occid and the orient . the librari look , for the most part , as < br > though it belong in a handsom summer-plac of the new england coast , < br > but thi smaller room wa as foreign as the ambassador himself . the air < br > wa heavi with the smell of sandal-wood . the massiv tabl and chair < br > were of teak and eboni cunningli carv . the wall were hung with < br > embroideri of crimson and gold , on which grotesqu dragon writh in < br > intric convolut . the piec of porcelain , jade , and cloisonné < br > were not mani , but they had been fashion by the artist of dead < br > dynasti and were almost beyond price . upon a long panel of silk wa < br > display a row of chines charact cut from black velvet and sewn < br > to the fabric . they were mere the symbol of good fortun commonli < br > to be found in such an environ as thi , a sort of equival of < br > the old-fashion motto , “ god bless our home , ” but to captain michael < br > o ’ shea they carri an uncomfort suggest of the handiwork done < br > upon the back of bill maguir . < br > < br > hi excel hao su ting seat himself besid the tabl , < br > deliber put on hi round spectacl with heavi tortoise-shel < br > rim , and tuck hi hand insid hi flow sleev . the deferenti < br > secretari stood wait for him to speak . o ’ shea fidget and yearn < br > to break the silenc . the air had turn chill with an east wind that < br > blew strong and damp from the sea . nevertheless the ambassador found it < br > necessari to take a handkerchief from hi sleev and wipe the littl < br > bead of perspir from hi bald brow . o ’ shea made note of it , and < br > wonder what power emot move behind the round spectacl and < br > calm , benign counten of the diplomat . < br > < br > at length he spoke to the secretari in chines and indic o ’ shea < br > with a slow wave of the hand . the young man translat with some < br > unreadi as though endeavor to bring the word within the bound < br > of courtesi . < br > < br > “ hi excel say that it is imposs , that you are mistaken . he < br > is not convinced. ” < br > < br > “ he call me a liar ? ” and o ’ shea ’ s sens of humor wa stir . with hi < br > easi , boyish laugh he ad : “ ’ ti your own reput for verac < br > that need overhaulin ’ , me lad . your own two eye have seen the thing . < br > i had the proof , but ye would not let me take the two-leg document < br > by the collar and fetch him to the house. ” < br > < br > the ambassador turn to the tabl at hi elbow . upon it wa an ink box < br > and a soft brush use for write hi own languag . from a drawer he < br > withdrew a sheet of rice-pap . shove these toward o ’ shea , he said < br > someth and the secretari explain : < br > < br > “ he wish you to write what it is like , the thing that i also have < br > seen . pleas be good enough to oblige. ” < br > < br > the brand wa etch in o ’ shea ’ s memori . without hesit he pick < br > up the brush and blazon the charact in broad , firm stroke . for < br > perhap a minut hi excel gaze at it . then he caught up the < br > sheet of rice-pap and tore it into small fragment . < br > < br > “ he is now convinc that you and i speak truth , ” the secretari < br > murmur in o ’ shea ’ s ear . < br > < br > “ well and good . he look as if it made him unwel . now can we get down < br > to busi and tackl the mysteri of it ? it is chines write . what < br > doe it mean ? that is me errand. ” < br > < br > hi excel hao su ting no longer resembl a round-fac buddha < br > seat in repos medit upon a throne of teak-wood . the < br > word came from him in a torrenti flow , and the harsh , sing-song < br > inton were terribl in earnest . it wa a harangu that warn , < br > expostul , lament with all the fervor of an issu that concern < br > life and death . it startl o ’ shea to behold a man of hi unemot < br > race , and one so hedg about with the digniti of rank , in thi < br > stormi tide of feel . it ceas abruptli . the old man sank into hi < br > chair and close hi eye . the secretari rang a gong for a servant < br > and order tea . present the ambassador signifi that he wish < br > to retir to a couch , and other of hi staff attend him into the < br > librari and thenc to an upper floor of the hous . < br > < br > the secretari return to join o ’ shea and began to explain in hi < br > measur , monoton way : < br > < br > “ i will now inform you as much as it is permit to know . it < br > disappoint you , i am awar , that hi excel is unabl to translat < br > the write charact which ha made so much disturb . nor can < br > i translat it , either into chines or english word . my languag < br > is what you call arbitrari , built up of symbol , not letter . thi < br > particular charact ha been invent to signifi some secret purpos . < br > it ha the root-sign for _man_ , and also the two curv line which < br

abl to find in < br > the classic or the dictionaries. ” < br > < br > more puzzl than ever , o ’ shea broke in to demand : < br > < br > “ but if nobodi know what it mean , whi doe the sight of it start a < br > full-siz panic ? ” < br > < br > “ mani men in china have been found dead , and upon their back had been < br > hack with a sword thi strang charact . it wa thu that the own < br > brother of hi excel wa discov , in the court-yard of hi < br > house. ” < br > < br > “ i begin to see daylight , ” said o ’ shea . < br > < br > “ ah , there is onli the blackest dark , ” grave repli the < br > secretari . “ the brand men have not been cooli , but offici , < br > merchant , peopl of station . no precaut avail . it smite them like < br > the lightn from the sky . the fear of it walk everywher . and now it < br > ha cross the sea like an evil shadow. ” < br > < br > “ that is not quit right , ” wa the matter-of-fact comment . “ poor bill < br > maguir got it in china and brought it with him . ’ ti not like to < br > troubl you. ” < br > < br > “ never have we heard of a man who live and walk with thi mark upon < br > hi back , captain o ’ shea . all those to whom thi

but i tell you my blood turn to water < br > and my heart wa squeez tight. ” < br > < br > “ my friend maguir is hard to kill , ” said o ’ shea . “ i tri it meself . < br > so he wa put on the list by thi damnabl whatever-it-i , and the < br > autograph wa carv on him , and he wa left for dead ! can ye tell me < br > ani more ? ” < br > < br > “ it is not in my power to enlighten you . i have known of men who found < br > thi charact paint on the post of their gate-way . they surround < br > themselv with soldier and hire guard . they move not from within < br > their own wall . and they could not save themselv . they die as i < br > have describ it to you. ” < br > < br > “ i have listen to pleasant yarn . i am greatli oblig to ye , ” and < br > o ’ shea wa readi to take hi departur . “ i am afraid i will know no < br > more unless bill maguir uncork himself and confid the stori of hi < br > life. ” < br > < br > “ when the time come it will interest me greatli to be inform of it , ” <

shipmast hasten on foot to the railroad station , where johnni < br > kent wa patient and peac await order . the red-hair < br > sailor wa sit on a baggag truck and munch peanut . at sight < br > of o ’ shea he grin in recognit and wave a greet hand . the < br > engin wa eager for tide , but a train wa almost due and he wa < br > briefli assur : < br > < br > “ ’ ti a bugaboo tale , johnni , and we will digest it at our leisur . and < br > how ha bill behav himself ? ” < br > < br > “ as good as gold , cap ’ n mike . but there ’ s someth goin ’ on insid < br > him . hi eye look brighter and he ha mumbl to himself sever < br > time . i dunno whether he ’ s primin ’ himself for anoth explos or < br > kind of rememberin ’ himself in spot . anyhow , he ha symptoms. ” < br > < br > “ we will steer him home as soon as we can , johnni . he ha enjoy an < br > excit afternoon. ” < br > < br > the locomot whistl and a few minut later they file into the < br > smoking-car . o ’ shea fish out a black cigar and hi comrad ram a < br > charg of cut plug into hi old clay pipe . no sooner had they light < br > match than their irrespons protégé reach over and snatch < br > them away . instead of tri to set fire to the car or to the abund < br > whisker of the old gentleman across the aisl he flung the match < br > on the floor and stamp them with hi heel . hi guardian regard < br > him with puzzl surpris , and were not quick enough to restrain him < br > befor he surg among the passeng and pluck from their face < br > everi light cigar , cigarett , and pipe . these he rude made way with < br > by grind them under hi feet or toss them through the window . < br > < br > the person thu outrag were for assault him until they perceiv < br > the width of hi shoulder , the depth of hi chest , and the color of < br > hi hair . the shipmast and the engin tackl him like a brace of < br > foot-bal player , yank him back to hi seat , and calm the ruffl < br > travel with explan and offer to pay damag . the blue eye < br > of bill maguir wa alertli rove to detect the first sign of smoke , < br > and dure the remaind of hi journey no one dare to burn the hazi < br > incens of tobacco . <

would call him a firebug no < br > longer . he ha turn himself into a fire department. ” < br > < br > “ that ’ s precis it , ” excitedli cri the other . “ and here ’ s how i < br > explain it . he ’ s had some mighti violent experi dure the last < br > twenty-four hour , what with your tryin ’ to knock hi head off and < br > runnin ’ him afoul of those chinamen which is hi pet avers . hi < br > intellect ha jar a mite loos from it dead centr , but one cog < br > slip into revers gear . in place of settin ’ fire , he want to put < br > ’ em out . hi machineri ain ’ t adjust right , but it ’ s movin ’ . instead < br > of start ahead on thi conflagr theori of hi , he goe full < br > speed astern. ” < br > < br > “ you are a know old barnacl , ” admiringli exclaim o ’ shea . “ thi < br > ought to make bill an easier problem to handl . the strain of keep < br > up with him begin to tell on me. ” < br > < br > “ pshaw , cap ’ n mike , i ’ ll set him to work on the farm if thi latest <

when the big , silent , red-hair stranger march into the < br > kitchen , halt to look at the blaze grate , and promptli caught up a < br > pail of water from the sink and flood the stove . johnni kent enter < br > a moment later and gaze aghast at the drip , sizzl ember . then < br > hi common-sens got the better of hi annoy and he shout to < br > o ’ shea : < br > < br > “ bill ’ s gear is still revers . coax him out on the porch and hold him < br > there while i get supper . he just put the stove awash. ” < br > < br > o ’ shea laugh and took charg of the derelict , while johnni lock the < br > kitchen door and window and rekindl the fire . freed from the fear < br > that the cottag and barn might go up in smoke , the comrad enjoy < br > a quiet even . maguir wa dispos of in the attic bedroom and < br > insist on go to bed in the dark . < br > < br > “ he will not wander away , ” said o ’ shea . “ hi wit are in a sad mess , < br > but he know he ha found a friendli anchorage. ” < br > < br > they felt the need of sleep , and johnni kent wa yawn befor he had < br > heard the end of the interview with hi excel hao su ting . it < br > entertain him , but the edg of hi interest wa blunt . the hapless < br > sailor in the attic had been struck down and mutil by some secret < br > organ of chines assassin , and there wa no find out the < br > mean of the brand upon hi back . it wa their trademark . thi wa < br > explan enough . it satisfi the engin ’ s curios . he had no < br > great amount of imagin , and although he wa readi to share hi < br > last dollar with the helpless maguir , he felt no further call to < br > pursu the mysteri of hi wrong . < br > < br > captain o ’ shea wa veri differ affect . he had not forsaken < br > the quest of adventur . hi soul wa not content with cabbag and < br > cow . the world beyond the horizon wa alway call in hi ear . < br > as children are fond of fairy-stori , so hi fanci wa lure by < br > the bizarr , the unexpect , the unknown . your true adventur is , < br > after all , onli a boy who ha never grown up . hi desir are wholli < br > unreason and he set a scandal exampl . if you had ask him the < br > question , thi rattle-head shipmast would have frankli answer < br > that noth could give him more enjoy than to sail for china and < br > tri to discov how and whi the brand had been put on maguir . besid , < br > he had an irishman ’ s habit of take over anoth man ’ s quarrel . < br > < br > “ poor bill can not squar it himself , ” reflect o ’ shea . “ ’ ti the duti < br > of some one to undertak it for him . it make an honest man ’ s blood < br > boil to think of the black wicked that wa done to him . as long as < br > the heathen are content to murder one anoth ’ ti no busi of < br > mine . but an american sailorman -- and mayb he is not the onli one. ” < br > < br > when he went downstair in the morn , johnni kent wa in the < br > barricad kitchen and maguir pace the porch with the air of a man < br > physic refresh . he paid no heed to o ’ shea , who wa amaz to < br > discov that he wa talk to himself . the sound he made were no < br > longer inarticul , but word and fragment of sentenc curious < br > jumbl . in the stress of great excit he had previous spoken < br > with brief coher , onli to laps into dumb . now , howev , with < br > no sudden stimulu to flash a ray of light into hi darken mind , he < br > wa begin to find himself , to grope for express like a child < br > pain and clumsili learn to read . to the listen o ’ shea it < br > sound like heap phrase togeth in a basket and fish them out < br > at random . < br > < br > the sailor ’ s voic had lost much of it harsh . it tone were < br > rather deep and pleasant . swing hi long arm as he walk , he kept < br > repeat such disjoint idea as these : < br > < br > “ _heav her short -- eleven dollar mex -- no , paddi blake -- a big wax < br > doll -- all clear forward , sir -- stink river -- roll the dice -- the < br > paint joss -- a year from home -- way enough -- wang li fu -- die like < br > rat -- sampan , ahoy -- no more drink -- good-bi , mari dear -- in the paint < br > locker -- the head-devil -- fish and potatoes._ ” < br > < br > it made o ’ shea feel dizzi to listen to thi intermin nonsens , but < br > he follow it most attent , and stole behind a lilac-bush lest < br > maguir should spi him and be divert from hi mad soliloquy . for some < br > time there wa no catch hold of a clew , but at length the shrewd < br > shipmast began to sift out certain phrase which were emphas by < br > reiter . they were , in a way , the _motif_ of the jargon , hint of < br > impress most clearli stamp on the man ’ s mind . < br > < br > he mention again and again “ _the paint joss_ , ” and occasion < br > coupl it with refer to “ _the stink river_. ” stress seem < br > to be laid also on the proper name _wang li fu_ . mani of the other < br > fragment o ’ shea discard as worthless . some of them relat to < br > routin duti on shipboard . he hazard a guess that the sailor wa < br > a marri man . at ani rate , he had left a “ mari dear , ” and it wa a < br > plausibl conjectur that he had promis to bring home “ a big wax < br > doll. ” < br > < br > when maguir becam silent o ’ shea made for the kitchen and hammer on < br > the door . < br > < br > “ is that you , cap ’ n mike ? ” respond the perturb accent of johnni < br > kent . “ if it ’ s bill , he can stay out till breakfast ’ s cook . i don ’ t < br > want my stove drownd again. ” < br > < br > reassur , he cautious admit the shipmast who pound him on the < br > back and shout : < br > < br > “ bill ha been leakin ’ languag from everi pore . ’ ti all snarl up < br > most comic , but i seem to get hold of a loos end now and then. ” < br > < br > “ hooray , cap ’ n mike ! it ’ s just as i said . when you hit him over the ear < br > it sort of jar hi brain loos . it ain ’ t fetch clear yet , but he ’ s < br > begun to make steam in hi crazi fashion . what doe he say ? ” < br > < br > “ wait till i tow him in to breakfast and mayb he will start up again. ” < br > < br > but maguir ate in silenc and o ’ shea could not persuad him to pick up < br > the rambl monologu . johnni kent therefor escort the sailor to < br > the garden , gave him a hoe , and thriftili set him to work . he fell to < br > with the greatest good-wil and show an aptitud which betoken an < br > earlier acquaint with thi form of husbandri . < br > < br > after a discuss of some length the engin exclaim : < br > < br > “ you ’ re a bright man , cap ’ n mike , but you haven ’ t knock around the < br > chines port as much as i have . bill mention one or two thing < br > that i can elucid . paddi blake , eh ? so he know paddi blake . the < br > blackguard run a sailor ’ rum-shop in shanghai . it ’ s just off the < br > bund , as you turn up the street that ’ s next to the french concess . < br > i ’ ve roll the dice for drink there myself and blown my wage and < br > mix up in some free-for-al fight that would have done your heart < br > good. ” < br > < br > “ ’ ti a glimps into the fog , johnni . mayb thi rapscallion of a < br > paddi blake would know poor old bill if he had a descript of him . < br > we can guess at some of the rest of it . bill went up a chines river < br > somewher and got in black troubl ashor . it had to do with a templ < br > and a joss. ” < br > < br > “ one of them big carv wooden idol , cap ’ n mike , paint all red and < br > yellow and white. ” < br > < br > “ and it look to me as if he stumbl into a headquart of thi bunch < br > of thug that ha been deal out sudden death to promin chines < br > citizen , johnni . anyhow , he ran afoul of some kind of a ‘ head-devil , ’ < br > as he call it , and wa left for dead. ” < br > < br > “ then it ’ s possibl that bill know the secret of thi organ of < br > cock-ey murder , ” excitedli cri the engin . < br > < br > “ the same notion is in me own mind , ” repli o ’ shea . < br > < br > a dusti man just then rode a bicycl into the door-yard and dismount < br > to give the shipmast a yellow envelop . < br > < br > “ i guess you ’ re captain michael o ’ shea , ” said he . “ the station agent < br > got thi telegram for you and ask me to stop and deliv it , seein ’ < br > as i wa passin ’ thi way . how are you , mr.
