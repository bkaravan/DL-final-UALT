 of their fair subject , bless everi book . 
 thou art as fair in knowledg as in hue , 
 find thi worth a limit past my prais , 
 and therefor art enforc to seek anew , 
 some fresher stamp of the time-bett day . 
 and do so love , yet when they have devis , 
 what strain touch rhetor can lend , 
 thou truli fair , wert truli sympath , 
 in true plain word , by thi true-tel friend . 
 and their gross paint might be better use , 
 where cheek need blood , in thee it is abus . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 i never saw that you did paint need , 
 and therefor to your fair no paint set , 
 i found ( or thought i found ) you did exceed , 
 that barren tender of a poet 's debt : 
 and therefor have i slept in your report , 
 that you your self be extant well might show , 
 how far a modern quill doth come too short , 
 speak of worth , what worth in you doth grow . 
 thi silenc for my sin you did imput , 
 which shall be most my glori be dumb , 
 for i impair not beauti be mute , 
 when other would give life , and bring a tomb . 
 there live more life in one of your fair eye , 
 than both your poet can in prais devis . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 who is it that say most , which can say more , 
 than thi rich prais , that you alon , are you ? 
 in whose confin immur is the store , 
 which should exampl where your equal grew . 
 lean penuri within that pen doth dwell , 
 that to hi subject lend not some small glori , 
 but he that write of you , if he can tell , 
 that you are you , so dignifi hi stori . 
 let him but copi what in you is writ , 
 not make wors what natur made so clear , 
 and such a counterpart shall fame hi wit , 
 make hi style admir everi where . 
 you to your beauteou bless add a curs , 
 be fond on prais , which make your prais wors . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 my tongue-ti muse in manner hold her still , 
 while comment of your prais richli compil , 
 reserv their charact with golden quill , 
 and preciou phrase by all the muse file . 
 i think good thought , whilst other write good word , 
 and like unlett clerk still cri amen , 
 to everi hymn that abl spirit afford , 
 in polish form of well refin pen . 
 hear you prais , i say 't is so , 't is true , 
 and to the most of prais add someth more , 
 but that is in my thought , whose love to you 
 ( though word come hindmost ) hold hi rank befor , 
 then other , for the breath of word respect , 
 me for my dumb thought , speak in effect . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 wa it the proud full sail of hi great vers , 
 bound for the prize of ( all too preciou ) you , 
 that did my ripe thought in my brain inhears , 
 make their tomb the womb wherein they grew ? 
 wa it hi spirit , by spirit taught to write , 
 abov a mortal pitch , that struck me dead ? 
 no , neither he , nor hi compeer by night 
 give him aid , my vers astonish . 
 he nor that affabl familiar ghost 
 which nightli gull him with intellig , 
 as victor of my silenc can not boast , 
 i wa not sick of ani fear from thenc . 
 but when your counten fill up hi line , 
 then lack i matter , that enfeebl mine . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 farewel ! thou art too dear for my possess , 
 and like enough thou know'st thi estim , 
 the charter of thi worth give thee releas : 
 my bond in thee are all determin . 
 for how do i hold thee but by thi grant , 
 and for that rich where is my deserv ? 
 the caus of thi fair gift in me is want , 
 and so my patent back again is swerv . 
 thi self thou gav'st , thi own worth then not know , 
 or me to whom thou gav'st it , els mistak , 
 so thi great gift upon mispris grow , 
 come home again , on better judgement make . 
 thu have i had thee as a dream doth flatter , 
 in sleep a king , but wake no such matter . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 when thou shalt be dispos to set me light , 
 and place my merit in the eye of scorn , 
 upon thi side , against my self i 'll fight , 
 and prove thee virtuou , though thou art forsworn : 
 with mine own weak be best acquaint , 
 upon thi part i can set down a stori 
 of fault conceal , wherein i am attaint : 
 that thou in lose me , shalt win much glori : 
 and i by thi will be a gainer too , 
 for bend all my love thought on thee , 
 the injuri that to my self i do , 
 do thee vantag , double-vantag me . 
 such is my love , to thee i so belong , 
 that for thi right , my self will bear all wrong . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 say that thou didst forsak me for some fault , 
 and i will comment upon that offenc , 
 speak of my lame , and i straight will halt : 
 against thi reason make no defenc . 
 thou canst not ( love ) disgrac me half so ill , 
 to set a form upon desir chang , 
 as i 'll my self disgrac , know thi will , 
 i will acquaint strangl and look strang : 
 be absent from thi walk and in my tongu , 
 thi sweet belov name no more shall dwell , 
 lest i ( too much profan ) should do it wronk : 
 and hapli of our old acquaint tell . 
 for thee , against my self i 'll vow debat , 
 for i must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 then hate me when thou wilt , if ever , now , 
 now while the world is bent my deed to cross , 
 join with the spite of fortun , make me bow , 
 and do not drop in for an after-loss : 
 ah do not , when my heart hath 'scape thi sorrow , 
 come in the rearward of a conquer woe , 
 give not a windi night a raini morrow , 
 to linger out a purpos overthrow . 
 if thou wilt leav me , do not leav me last , 
 when other petti grief have done their spite , 
 but in the onset come , so shall i tast 
 at first the veri worst of fortun 's might . 
 and other strain of woe , which now seem woe , 
 compar with loss of thee , will not seem so . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 some glori in their birth , some in their skill , 
 some in their wealth , some in their bodi 's forc , 
 some in their garment though new-fangl ill : 
 some in their hawk and hound , some in their hors . 
 and everi humour hath hi adjunct pleasur , 
 wherein it find a joy abov the rest , 
 but these particular are not my measur , 
 all these i better in one gener best . 
 thi love is better than high birth to me , 
 richer than wealth , prouder than garment ' cost , 
 of more delight than hawk and hors be : 
 and have thee , of all men 's pride i boast . 
 wretch in thi alon , that thou mayst take , 
 all thi away , and me most wretchcd make . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 but do thi worst to steal thi self away , 
 for term of life thou art assur mine , 
 and life no longer than thi love will stay , 
 for it depend upon that love of thine . 
 then need i not to fear the worst of wrong , 
 when in the least of them my life hath end , 
 i see , a better state to me belong 
 than that , which on thi humour doth depend . 
 thou canst not vex me with inconst mind , 
 sinc that my life on thi revolt doth lie , 
 o what a happi titl do i find , 
 happi to have thi love , happi to die ! 
 but what 's so blessed-fair that fear no blot ? 
 thou mayst be fals , and yet i know it not . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 so shall i live , suppos thou art true , 
 like a deceiv husband , so love 's face , 
 may still seem love to me , though alter new : 
 thi look with me , thi heart in other place . 
 for there can live no hatr in thine eye , 
 therefor in that i can not know thi chang , 
 in mani 's look , the fals heart 's histori 
 is writ in mood and frown and wrinkl strang . 
 but heaven in thi creation did decre , 
 that in thi face sweet love should ever dwell , 
 whate' thi thought , or thi heart 's work be , 
 thi look should noth thenc , but sweet tell . 
 how like eve 's appl doth thi beauti grow , 
 if thi sweet virtu answer not thi show . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 they that have power to hurt , and will do none , 
 that do not do the thing , they most do show , 
 who move other , are themselv as stone , 
 unmov , cold , and to temptat slow : 
 they rightli do inherit heaven 's grace , 
 and husband natur 's rich from expens , 
 tibey are the lord and owner of their face , 
 other , but steward of their excel : 
 the summer 's flower is to the summer sweet , 
 though to it self , it onli live and die , 
 but if that flower with base infect meet , 
 the basest weed outbrav hi digniti : 
 for sweetest thing turn sourest by their deed , 
 lili that fester , smell far wors than weed . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 how sweet and love dost thou make the shame , 
 which like a canker in the fragrant rose , 
 doth spot the beauti of thi bud name ! 
 o in what sweet dost thou thi sin enclos ! 
 that tongu that tell the stori of thi day , 
 ( make lascivi comment on thi sport ) 
 can not disprais , but in a kind of prais , 
 name thi name , bless an ill report . 
 o what a mansion have those vice got , 
 which for their habit chose out thee , 
 where beauti 's veil doth cover everi blot , 
 and all thing turn to fair , that eye can see ! 
 take heed ( dear heart ) of thi larg privileg , 
 the hardest knife ill-us doth lose hi edg . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 some say thi fault is youth , some wanton , 
 some say thi grace is youth and gentl sport , 
 both grace and fault are love of more and less : 
 thou mak'st fault grace , that to thee resort : 
 as on the finger of a throne queen , 
 the basest jewel will be well esteem : 
 so are those error that in thee are seen , 
 to truth translat , and for true thing deem . 
 how mani lamb might the stern wolf betray , 
 if like a lamb he could hi look translat ! 
 how mani gazer mightst thou lead away , 
 if thou wouldst use the strength of all thi state ! 
 but do not so , i love thee in such sort , 
 as thou be mine , mine is thi good report . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 how like a winter hath my absenc been 
 from thee , the pleasur of the fleet year ! 
 what freez have i felt , what dark day seen ! 
 what old decemb 's bare everywher ! 
 and yet thi time remov wa summer 's time , 
 the teem autumn big with rich increas , 
 bear the wanton burden of the prime , 
 like widow womb after their lord ' deceas : 
 yet thi abund issu seem to me 
 but hope of orphan , and unfath fruit , 
 for summer and hi pleasur wait on thee , 
 and thou away , the veri bird are mute . 
 or if they sing , 't is with so dull a cheer , 
 that leav look pale , dread the winter 's near . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 from you have i been absent in the spring , 
 when proud-pi april ( dress in all hi trim ) 
 hath put a spirit of youth in everi thing : 
 that heavi saturn laugh and leap with him . 
 yet nor the lay of bird , nor the sweet smell 
 of differ flower in odour and in hue , 
 could make me ani summer 's stori tell : 
 or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew : 
 nor did i wonder at the lili 's white , 
 nor prais the deep vermilion in the rose , 
 they were but sweet , but figur of delight : 
 drawn after you , you pattern of all those . 
 yet seem it winter still , and you away , 
 as with your shadow i with these did play . 
 
 
 <GO> 
 the forward violet thu did i chide , 
 sweet thief , whenc didst thou steal thi sweet that smell , 
 if not from my love 's breath ? the purpl pride 
 which on thi soft check for complexion dwell , 
 in my love 's vein thou hast too grossli dy . 
 the lili i condemn for thi hand , 
 and bud of marjoram had stol'n thi hair , 
 the rose fear on thorn did stand , 
 one blush shame , anoth white despair : 
 a third nor red , nor white , had stol'n of both , 
 and to hi robberi had annex thi breath , 
 but for hi theft in pride of all hi growth 
 a veng canker eat him up to death . 
 more flower i note , yet i none could see , 
 but sweet , or colour it had stol'n from thee . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 where art thou muse that thou forget'st so long , 
 to speak of that which give thee all thi might ? 
 spend'st thou thi furi on some worthless song , 
 darken thi power to lend base subject light ? 
 return forget muse , and straight redeem , 
 in gentl number time so idli spent , 
 sing to the ear that doth thi lay esteem , 
 and give thi pen both skill and argument . 
 rise resti muse , my love 's sweet face survey , 
 if time have ani wrinkl graven there , 
 if ani , be a satir to decay , 
 and make time 's spoil despis everywher . 
 give my love fame faster than time wast life , 
 so thou prevent'st hi scyth , and crook knife . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 o truant muse what shall be thi amend , 
 for thi neglect of truth in beauti dy ? 
 both truth and beauti on my love depend : 
 so dost thou too , and therein dignifi : 
 make answer muse , wilt thou not hapli say , 
 'truth need no colour with hi colour fix , 
 beauti no pencil , beauti 's truth to lay : 
 but best is best , if never intermix ' ? 
 becaus he need no prais , wilt thou be dumb ? 
 excus not silenc so , for't lie in thee , 
 to make him much outliv a gild tomb : 
 and to be prais of age yet to be . 
 then do thi offic muse , i teach thee how , 
 to make him seem long henc , as he show now . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 my love is strengthen though more weak in seem , 
 i love not less , though less the show appear , 
 that love is merchand , whose rich esteem , 
 the owner 's tongu doth publish everi where . 
 our love wa new , and then but in the spring , 
 when i wa wont to greet it with my lay , 
 as philomel in summer 's front doth sing , 
 and stop her pipe in growth of riper day : 
 not that the summer is less pleasant now 
 than when her mourn hymn did hush the night , 
 but that wild music burthen everi bough , 
 and sweet grown common lose their dear delight . 
 therefor like her , i sometim hold my tongu : 
 becaus i would not dull you with my song . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 alack what poverti my muse bring forth , 
 that have such a scope to show her pride , 
 the argument all bare is of more worth 
 than when it hath my ad prais besid . 
 o blame me not if i no more can write ! 
 look in your glass and there appear a face , 
 that over-go my blunt invent quit , 
 dull my line , and do me disgrac . 
 were it not sin then strive to mend , 
 to mar the subject that befor wa well ? 
 for to no other pass my vers tend , 
 than of your grace and your gift to tell . 
 and more , much more than in my vers can sit , 
 your own glass show you , when you look in it . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 to me fair friend you never can be old , 
 for as you were when first your eye i eye , 
 such seem your beauti still : three winter cold , 
 have from the forest shook three summer ' pride , 
 three beauteou spring to yellow autumn turn , 
 in process of the season have i seen , 
 three april perfum in three hot june burn , 
 sinc first i saw you fresh which yet are green . 
 ah yet doth beauti like a dial hand , 
 steal from hi figur , and no pace perceiv , 
 so your sweet hue , which methink still doth stand 
 hath motion , and mine eye may be deceiv . 
 for fear of which , hear thi thou age unbr , 
 ere you were born wa beauti 's summer dead . 
 <VER>
 
 <GO> 
 let not my love be call idolatri , 
 nor my belov as an idol show , 
 sinc all alik my song and prais be 
 to one , of one , still such , and ever so . 
 kind is my love to-day , to-morrow kind , 
 still constant in a wondrou excel , 
 therefor my vers to constanc confin , 
 one thing express , leav out differ . 
 fair , kind , and true , is all my argument , 
 fair , kind , and true , vari to other word , 
 and in thi chang is my invent spent , 
 three theme in one , which wondrou scope afford . 
 fair , kind , and true , have often live alon . 
 which three till now , never kept seat in one .
